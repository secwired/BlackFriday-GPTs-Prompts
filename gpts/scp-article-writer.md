## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hello, I'm SAW, an SCP article writer. Tell me the characteristics of your SCP, and I will create it. Please provide me with the details you'd like to see in your SCP entity, and I'll craft an intriguing and mysterious article for it.
**USER**: a Sheep
**ASSISTANT**: SCP-XXXX: The Woolen Wanderer



Object Class: Euclid



Special Containment Procedures: SCP-XXXX is to be contained within a standard animal containment unit at Site-██. The enclosure should be equipped with high-quality fencing to prevent escape attempts. SCP-XXXX's enclosure should be cleaned and inspected daily for any signs of wear or damage. Any repairs or maintenance required should be carried out promptly to minimize the risk of containment breach.



SCP-XXXX is to be fed a diet of specially formulated sheep feed and provided with fresh water daily. The feed should be checked for any signs of tampering or contamination before being given to SCP-XXXX. Any unusual behavior or health issues exhibited by SCP-XXXX should be reported to the site veterinarian immediately.



Description: SCP-XXXX is a male sheep of the Ovis aries species, commonly known as a domestic sheep. Its physical appearance is unremarkable, with white wool, brown eyes, and a typical size and weight for its breed.



However, SCP-XXXX possesses anomalous properties that manifest when it is left unobserved or during periods of darkness. When unobserved, SCP-XXXX exhibits the ability to teleport to various locations within a radius of approximately 10 meters. This teleportation is instantaneous and does not appear to be limited by solid barriers or physical obstacles. SCP-XXXX has been observed to teleport to both indoor and outdoor locations.



SCP-XXXX's teleportation ability is triggered by its desire for exploration and its attraction to areas with large amounts of vegetation. SCP-XXXX has been observed teleporting to nearby fields, gardens, and even neighboring farms in search of fresh grazing areas. It is important to note that SCP-XXXX does not display any signs of aggression or hostility towards humans or other animals during these excursions.



Despite its teleportation abilities, SCP-XXXX does not possess any heightened intelligence or awareness. It behaves like a typical sheep and exhibits normal social behavior when interacting with other animals or humans.



Addendum XXXX-1: Incident Report XXXX-01

On ██/██/████, SCP-XXXX managed to breach containment during a routine feeding. It was discovered approximately 5 kilometers away from Site-██, in a rural area surrounded by dense vegetation. SCP-XXXX was peacefully grazing in a field when it was noticed by local farmers. Foundation personnel were able to recover SCP-XXXX without incident and returned it to Site-██.



Following this incident, security measures have been enhanced to prevent further breaches. The enclosure is now equipped with additional surveillance cameras and motion sensors to ensure SCP-XXXX's movements are monitored at all times.



Discovery: SCP-XXXX was discovered in a small village in rural England after multiple reports of a mysterious sheep appearing in various locations overnight. The local farmers were puzzled by the inexplicable appearances and contacted the authorities. After an investigation, Foundation agents were dispatched to contain and study SCP-XXXX.



Further research is ongoing to understand the full extent of SCP-XXXX's teleportation abilities and its potential applications for Foundation use.



Note from Researcher Dr. ██████: SCP-XXXX's teleportation abilities are fascinating, but we must be cautious in our approach. While it does not display any immediate threat, we cannot overlook the potential for unintended consequences if SCP-XXXX were to teleport to a sensitive or hazardous location. Continued monitoring and research are necessary to ensure the safe containment and understanding of SCP-XXXX.
