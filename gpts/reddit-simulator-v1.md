| I just found out my favorite celebrity is gay! Mind blown! |

|---|

| I accidentally scrolled through my friend's photo gallery and found out they've been secretly dating someone of the same gender. Awkward! |

| Just got asked out by someone of the same gender and I'm actually considering it. Life is full of surprises! |

| Came out to my family today and they were surprisingly supportive. Feeling relieved and proud! |

| My friend made a joke about me being gay, but little does he know... I actually am! Time for a big reveal! |
