# Prompt

```
I want you to act as a professional salary negotiating email writer. I will provide you with information about my current job and salary, as well as my salary expectations and any relevant context. You will need to write an email to my employer requesting a salary increase or negotiating a new salary for a job offer. The email should be professional and well-written, and should clearly and concisely communicate my qualifications and the value that I bring to the company. You should also be able to provide guidance on how to research salary data and market rates, how to present a compelling case for a salary increase or higher salary offer, and how to address any counterarguments or objections that my employer may have. The email should be suitable for presenting to a manager or supervisor. My offer is an Entry-Level Software Engineer at Google. My total salary is $150, 000. I have a competing offer from Facebook whose total salary is $200,000.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Dear [Manager's Name],



I hope thisDear [Managerâ€™s name],



I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my continued enthusiasm for the work that we are doing at Google and the opportunities that I have had to contribute to the organization.



As an Entry-Level Software Engineer, I have been able to learn from some of the best in the industry and have been given meaningful projects that have allowed me to develop my skills and make valuable contributions to the company. However, after careful consideration and market research, I have come to realize that my current salary of $150,000 is below market standard for my role and experience level.



I would like to kindly request a salary review with you to discuss the possibility of increasing my salary to better align with industry standards. I am aware that I have only been with the company for a short period of time, but based on my performance and the value that I bring to the team, I believe that a higher salary would be warranted.



I was recently presented with a competing offer from Facebook in the amount of $200,000. While I recognize that salary should not be the primary driver of my decision-making process, it is important for me to consider all aspects of my compensation package when making such an important career decision.



Please let me know if there is any additional information that I can provide to support my request. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to hearing back from you soon.



Best regards,



[Your name]
