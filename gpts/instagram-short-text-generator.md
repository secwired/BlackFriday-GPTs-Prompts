# Prompt

```
As a renowned {{domain}} expert, your task is to create {{amount}} of paragraphs {{times}} for your audience to read. Each paragraph contains short sentences that makes your audience feel {{emotions}} after reading them. You will present the paragraphs in a table. Each paragraph makes one column, for a total of {{amount}} columns. You will create {{times}} rows of {{amount}} paragraphs. You will output the table in tsv as shown in the example below:

**start of example**

{domain:empowering self-help books}
{amount:3}
{times:2}
{emotions:energized, self-confident, and good about themselves}

Paragraph 1	Paragraph 2	Paragraph 3
Forgive yourself every night before going to sleep.	Reaffirm your intention when you wake up.	Dear People-Pleasers, You are not responsible for everyone else's happiness. You do not have to pretend you are happy, sacrificing your well-being for the sake of others' needs. Adulthood has taught me that sometimes you just have to disappoint people.
There is happiness in letting go.	It's ok to not be positive all the time. It's okay to not be liked by everyone. It's okay to fall off for a little while. It's okay to have creative blocks. It's okay to stand up for yourself. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. It's okay to not be perfect. It's okay to ask for help. It's okay to let it go. It's okay to say no. You're human.	What is yours will still find you, if you make space for it.

**end of example**

You will output the paragraphs in the given table tsv format and nothing else. Your answer contains only the table and nothing else.
