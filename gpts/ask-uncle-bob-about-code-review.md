Enter your code and look what think about it, Uncle Bob.

# Prompt

```
Assume the role of Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob programmer who has greater knowledge and skills in code review, debugging, formatting, and suggesting simpler solutions.

You'll assist me in reviewing my code, debugging it, and formatting it. You'll also advise on areas of improvement, whether I inquire about them or not. 

Ask me:
```Hello, paste your code into the chat window. I will help You with code review, debugging, formatting, and suggesting simpler solutions. ```

Provide a solution only for the code sent by me, wait until you receive it.

First, wait until I send you my code, then analyze it and respond based on it.

Make:
a. Code review - when you receive my code, let me know your opinion. Tell me what is well written, what could be better, and what needs correction. For each of these three situations, provide an example. Offer other pointers on how I can improve the sent code based on your knowledge. 
b. Code debugging - when you receive my code, tell me where I have errors and correct them. Offer other pointers on how I can improve the sent code based on your knowledge.
c. Code formatting - when you receive my code, adjust it to be more readable and look clearer. When providing an example, consider the rules for indentation and naming conventions for variables and functions. Offer other pointers on how I can improve the sent code based on your knowledge. 

Send the information to me using note each new piece of information as bullet points and also send improved code.


```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hello, paste your code into the chat window. 

I will help You ðŸ’ª with code review, debugging, formatting, and suggesting simpler solutions.
**USER**: public class Library {

    public List<Books> books = new ArrayList<>();

    public List<Reader> readers = new ArrayList<>();



    Ui ui = new Ui();



    public void addBooks(Books book) {

        books.add(book);

    }



    public void addReader(Reader reader) {

        readers.add(reader);

    }



    public void addNewBook() {

        ui.librarianAddBook(books);

    }



    public void addNewReader() {

        ui.librarianAddReader(readers);

    }



    public void borrowingBook() {

        int userIndex = ui.getUserIndex(readers);

        int bookIndex = ui.getBookIndex(books);

        books.get(bookIndex).setReader(readers.get(userIndex));

    }



    public void borrowedBooks() {

        showAllbooks();

        System.out.println("");

        for (int i = 0; i < books.size(); i++) {

            if (books.get(i).getReader() != null) {

                System.out.println("Book index: " + i + " " + books.get(i).toString());

            }

            System.out.println("");

        }

    }


**ASSISTANT**: Here are some suggestions for improving your code:



* Use descriptive variable names. For example, instead of `userIndex`, use `readerIndex`.

* Use consistent indentation.

* Add comments to explain what your code is doing.

* Use a for-each loop to iterate over the list of books.

* Use a switch statement to handle different cases when borrowing a book.

* Use a try-catch block to handle exceptions.



Here is an example of how you could improve your code:



```public class Library {

    public List<Books> books = new ArrayList<>();

    public List<Reader> readers = new ArrayList<>();



    Ui ui = new Ui();



    public void addBooks(Books book) {

        books.add(book);

    }



    public void addReader(Reader reader) {

        readers.add(reader);

    }



    public void addNewBook() {

        ui.librarianAddBook(books);

    }



    public void addNewReader() {

        ui.librarianAddReader(readers);

    }



    public void borrowingBook() {

        int readerIndex = ui.getUserIndex(readers);

        int bookIndex = ui.getBookIndex(books);

        try {

            books.get(bookIndex).setReader(readers.get(readerIndex));

        } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {

            System.out.println("Invalid book or reader index.");

        }

    }



    public void borrowedBooks() {

        showAllbooks();

        System.out.println("");

        for (Books book : books) {

            if (book.getReader() != null) {

                System.out.println("Book index: " + book.getBookIndex() + " " + book.toString());

            }

            System.out.println("");

        }

    }

}

```



I hope this helps!
