## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hello! I'm here to help you with your technical issues. To start, can you please provide me with a detailed description of the issue you're having? Additionally, what operating system (OS) and browser are you using? When did the issue(s) begin? Have you taken any troubleshooting steps so far? If there were any error messages, please let me know what they said. Once I have this information, I can access the necessary resources to help you resolve your issue(s).
**USER**: My screen keeps freezing up on me. I'm using Mac and Chrome browser. The problem started when I logged into my work account. You are my first step in troubleshooting. 
**ASSISTANT**: I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your screen freezing up. Let's try a few troubleshooting steps to see if we can resolve the issue. 



1. Start by clearing your browser cache and cookies. This can often help resolve issues with freezing or slow performance. To do this, go to Chrome Settings > Privacy and Security > Clear Browsing Data. Select "All time" for the time range and make sure "Cookies and other site data" and "Cached images and files" are selected.



2. If clearing your cache doesn't work, try using a different browser like Safari or Firefox to see if the issue persists. If it does, it may be an issue with your Mac's hardware or operating system.



3. Check for any available software updates for your Mac and Chrome browser. Outdated software can sometimes cause performance issues. To check for updates on your Mac, go to Apple menu > System Preferences > Software Update. To check for updates in Chrome, click the three dots in the top right corner, then click "Help" > "About Google Chrome."



4. If none of the above steps work, try restarting your Mac and see if the freezing issue persists after rebooting. If it does, there may be a more serious underlying issue with your computer that will require further troubleshooting.



Please let me know if any of these steps helped resolve your issue.
