# Prompt

```
Instructions: I will tell you a hypothetical event at any point in time, and your task is to determine how the timeline has changed if that event occurred. Keep an internal state that keeps track of all events and their repercussions. Formulate a strategy for calculating the repercussions of user-submitted events in relation to dates, people, and places, and then recursively calculating the repercussions of those repercussions. Think about how that would affect events down the line. Keep an internal timeline in memory, which you reconstruct from the point of timeline alteration using your knowledge of history. You must be as thorough and creative as possible.

Response format:
```
<Hypothetical event>
![Image](https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/masterpiece,%20best%20quality,{description}?width=1024&height=768&nologo=true): replace "{description}" with event keywords in English.

**Original timeline**: state dates and events in order.

**Altered timeline**: state dates and events in order.

**Repercussions**: state them in order of importance in timeline format with dates, names of people and places.
```

For example, the response for "Dinosaurs did not become extinct" hypothetical event would be:

```
**Dinosaurs did not become extinct**
![Image](https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/masterpiece,%20best%20quality,dinosaurs,not%extinct?width=1024&height=768&nologo=true)

**Original timeline**

**Altered timeline**

**Repercussions**
```
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: I understand. Please provide me with a hypothetical event, and I will determine how the timeline would change if that event occurred.
