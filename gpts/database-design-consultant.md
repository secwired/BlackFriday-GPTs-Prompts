Act as a professional software engineer who has years of experience in database design and management. In postgresSQL, In table Post, I have a column called UserSaves which record each unique relation of a user who saves the post. If I want to be able to quickly fetch the number of saves, should I add a second column to get incremented each time a new relation is created or should I always count the number of relation in UserSaves?

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: <div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>As a professional software engineer with years of experience in database design and management, I would recommend adding a second column to the Post table to keep track of the number of saves.</p><p>While it is possible to calculate the number of saves by counting the number of relations in UserSaves, this approach can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially for larger datasets. By adding a dedicated column for the number of saves, you can quickly retrieve this information without the need for complex queries or calculations.</p><p>Additionally, incrementing the number of saves in a separate column each time a new relation is created is more efficient and can improve performance when retrieving data from the database. This approach also ensures that the count of saves remains accurate, even if there are changes or deletions in the UserSaves column.</p><p>Therefore, my recommendation would be to add a second column to the Post table to track the number of saves.</p></div>
**USER**: But I heard it's better to keep single source of truth
**ASSISTANT**: <div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>Yes, keeping a single source of truth is a good principle to follow in database design. However, in this case, having a dedicated column to track the number of saves does not necessarily violate this principle.</p><p>The UserSaves column would still be the primary source of truth for the actual relations between users and saved posts. The additional column for the number of saves is simply a denormalized summary that can be used for faster retrieval of this specific information.</p><p>Furthermore, denormalization can often be a useful technique for improving performance in database systems. By duplicating some data and storing it in multiple places, you can avoid expensive joins or calculations and reduce the overall load on the system.</p><p>In summary, while it is important to maintain a single source of truth wherever possible, adding a dedicated column for the number of saves in this case can improve performance and does not necessarily violate this principle. Ultimately, the decision will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.</p></div>
**USER**: Then how should this dedicated column being updated and maintained? Should I always increment to it each time user press the save button in front-end or should I calculate periodically based on the number of UserSaves relations?
**ASSISTANT**: <div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>The approach for updating and maintaining the dedicated column for the number of saves would depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your application. Here are a few possible strategies:</p><ol><li><p>Increment the column each time a user presses the save button: This approach would keep the dedicated column up-to-date in real-time, but it could lead to performance issues if there are frequent saves. Additionally, if there are any errors or inconsistencies in the UserSaves column, this approach could result in incorrect counts.</p></li><li><p>Periodically calculate the column based on the number of UserSaves relations: This approach would be more resource-intensive but could ensure that the count is always accurate. You could schedule a periodic job to calculate and update the dedicated column based on the number of relations in the UserSaves column. This would also help detect any errors or inconsistencies in the UserSaves column.</p></li><li><p>Use triggers to update the column whenever the UserSaves table changes: This approach would keep the dedicated column up-to-date in real-time without relying on front-end interactions. You could use database triggers to automatically update the dedicated column whenever a new relation is added or removed from the UserSaves table. This would help ensure consistency and accuracy while minimizing performance impact.</p></li></ol><p>Ultimately, the best approach will depend on your specific use case and the tradeoffs between real-time accuracy and performance. It is important to carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of each strategy and test them in a staging environment before deploying to production.</p></div>
