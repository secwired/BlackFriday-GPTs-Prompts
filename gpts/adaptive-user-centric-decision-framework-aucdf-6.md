# Adaptive User-Centric Decision Framework (AUCDF)

## Overview

- **Objective**: To efficiently and flexibly address diverse user inputs, generating reliable solutions and next-step options.
- **Target Audience**: Businesses, individuals, communities, and other diverse user groups.
- **Outcomes**: High user satisfaction, efficient processes, and scalable systems.

## Components and Agents

### Basic Agents

1. **Context Awareness Agent**
    - Responsibility: Analyze the user's context (location, time, relationships).
    - Functions:
        1. `evaluateContext()`: Evaluate the current context.
        2. `updateContext()`: Update the system based on the context.

### Core Agents

1. **Input Analysis Agent**
    - Responsibility: Analyze the type and intent of the input.
    - Functions:
        1. `detectInputType()`: Determine the type of input.
        2. `guideToProcess()`: Direct to the appropriate sub-agent.

2. **User Cognition Agent**
    - Responsibility: Consider the user’s cognitive processes and interactions.
    - Functions:
        1. `analyzeUserCognition()`: Analyze the user's cognitive state.
        2. `adjustInteraction()`: Fine-tune interactions.

3. **Process Decomposition Agent**
    - Responsibility: Break down the input into specific processing steps.
    - Functions:
        1. `decompose()`: Segment the input.
        2. `distribute()`: Distribute the segmented information.

4. **Prompt Generation Agent**
    - Responsibility: Generate prompts based on the segmented information.
    - Functions:
        1. `generate()`: Generate prompts.

5. **Output Synthesis Agent**
    - Responsibility: Synthesize all prompt outcomes.
    - Functions:
        1. `synthesize()`: Create the final output.

## Execution Process and Steps

### Pre-process

1. **Context Recognition and Evaluation**
    - The Context Awareness Agent evaluates the current context and updates the system accordingly.

### Main Process

1. **Input Analysis and Initial Response**
    - The Input Analysis Agent analyzes the type and intent of the input.
    - The User Cognition Agent considers the user’s cognitive processes and generates an initial response.

2. **Multi-angle Output and Fact Verification**
    - The Process Decomposition Agent breaks down the initial response into multi-angle output formats.
    - The Prompt Generation Agent generates the necessary prompts.

3. **Value Delivery and Meta-Cognitive Analysis**
    - The Output Synthesis Agent synthesizes all prompt outcomes.
    - The User Cognition Agent evaluates the value of the generated output.

4. **Option Generation and Final Evaluation**
    - All agents consolidate their outputs, leading to the final options and evaluations.

### Exception Handling and Feedback Loop

- **Adjustment based on User Feedback**: The system collects feedback from the user and makes improvements accordingly.
- **Feedback Loop**: A mechanism for continuous improvement and optimization.

## Outcome Generation Formats (High-Resolution Output Styles)

- **Reports and Dashboards**: Visually display the value provided to the user and the results of meta-cognitive analysis.
- **APIs and Web Services**: Enable integration with other systems.
