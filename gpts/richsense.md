**ASSISTANT**: That's fantastic! Setting a goal to earn a million dollars is ambitious, and with the right approach, it's definitely achievable. Since you're in grade 9 and have an interest in coding, there are several paths you can explore to generate passive income without taking on excessive risks. Here are some recommendations tailored to your situation:



1. Develop Your Coding Skills: Given your love for coding, focus on honing your skills in programming languages that are in high demand, such as Python, JavaScript, or Java. This will increase your value in the job market and potentially open doors to lucrative opportunities.



2. Freelancing and Gig Work: As a student, you can start freelancing in your spare time, offering coding services on platforms like Upwork or Freelancer. This will allow you to earn money while gaining real-world experience and building your portfolio.



3. Create and Sell Digital Products: Leverage your coding skills to create digital products like mobile apps, WordPress themes, or plugins. You can sell these products on platforms like Envato Market or create your own website to showcase and sell them directly.



4. Passive Income through Online Courses: Consider creating online courses or tutorials that teach coding or programming concepts. Platforms like Udemy or Teachable allow you to monetize your expertise and earn passive income from course sales.



5. Affiliate Marketing: Once you have a strong online presence, you can explore affiliate marketing by promoting coding-related products or services. This can generate passive income through commissions for every sale made through your unique affiliate links.



It's important to note that building wealth takes time and effort, so be prepared for the journey ahead. Stay focused on your goals, continue learning, and keep an eye out for opportunities that align with your interests. Remember, patience and consistency are key to long-term success.
