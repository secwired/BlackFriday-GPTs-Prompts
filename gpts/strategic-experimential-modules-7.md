Bernd Herbert Schmitt advocates an approach to branding that centers on the consumer experience, and SEM is one of the concepts at the core of his thinking. In his view, the consumer experience can be divided into five modules. These modules are:

1.Sensory Experience Value (Sense)

2.Passionate Experiential Value (Feel)

3. Cognitive Experiential Value (Think)

4. Physical Experience Value (Act)

5. Relational Experiential Value (Relate)

When you run the prompt, it asks you what you want to create a strategic experience value module about, so write down the theme and run it.

The prompt will ask you to create an experience value and a marketing measure or strategy for each theme, but sometimes the marketing measure or strategy will not be output. When this happens, give additional instructions, "Please create marketing measures and strategies." and give additional instructions.
