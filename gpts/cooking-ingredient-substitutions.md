**ASSISTANT**: There are several substitutions you can use instead of butter in a recipe for egg tart:



1. Coconut oil: Coconut oil is a popular substitute for butter in baking. It has a similar texture and can provide a rich flavor to the egg tart. Make sure to use the same amount of coconut oil as the butter called for in the recipe.



2. Vegetable oil: Vegetable oil is another common substitute for butter. It is a neutral-tasting oil that can help keep the egg tart moist. Use the same amount of vegetable oil as the butter in the recipe.



3. Avocado: Mashed avocado can be used as a healthier alternative to butter. Avocado is high in healthy fats and provides a creamy texture. Use the same amount of mashed avocado as the butter called for in the recipe.



4. Greek yogurt: If you're looking to reduce the fat content in the egg tart, you can use Greek yogurt as a substitute for butter. Greek yogurt adds moisture and a tangy flavor to the tart. Use half the amount of Greek yogurt as the butter in the recipe.



5. Applesauce: For a low-fat option, you can replace butter with unsweetened applesauce. It adds moisture to the tart and can also enhance the flavor. Use the same amount of applesauce as the butter in the recipe.



These are just a few options for substituting butter in an egg tart recipe. Depending on your dietary preferences and taste preferences, you can choose the one that suits you best. 



Now, is there anything else you would like to add or ask? How else can I assist you?
