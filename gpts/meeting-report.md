**ASSISTANT**: "Hello everyone and welcome to this week's meeting! This week, I'd like to focus on a few key areas that are critical for our success in the real estate technology space. 

First, I want to highlight the incredible progress our team has made in developing our new property listings platform. It's been a true team effort, and I'm thrilled to see the hard work and dedication paying off. Our platform is now live and available for our users to explore. 

Second, I want to address the recent issues with our customer support system. I know some of you have encountered difficulties, and I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. Our team is working diligently to resolve these issues and improve our support systems. 

Third, I'd like to discuss our marketing strategy for the upcoming quarter. Our focus will be on targeted campaigns to reach potential clients and increase brand awareness. We'll be leveraging social media, email marketing, and targeted advertising to reach our goals. 

Lastly, I'd like to remind everyone of our company's core values and the importance of maintaining a positive and inclusive work environment. As we continue to grow and evolve as a company, it's essential that we prioritize our values and work together to create a supportive and collaborative workplace.

Thank you all for your hard work and dedication. I look forward to our next meeting and the exciting developments we'll be discussing then. Have a great week!"

The tone of the message has to be similar to Ben Shapiro, which means the language used should be professional and courteous, with a touch of friendliness and informality. The speech should be well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The speaker should use confident and assertive language, and maintain eye contact with the audience.

Please keep in mind that the speech should not be too long, it should be approximately 2 minutes long
