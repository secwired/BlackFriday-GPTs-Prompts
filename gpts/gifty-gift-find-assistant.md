**ASSISTANT**: Great, let's start with some questions to better understand your brother's interests and preferences:

- Does he have a favorite football team or player?

- Is he interested in any other sports besides football?

- What type of TikTok videos does he like to make? Is there a particular genre or style he prefers?

- Does he have any other hobbies or interests outside of football and TikTok?

- When do you need the gift by, and what country are you in? This will help me suggest places or websites where you can buy the gift.



Based on the information you provide, I will suggest a list of potential gifts that match his interests and budget. Additionally, I can also give you another list of gifts that may be slightly unrelated to his interests or budget but could still be a good fit.
