# Prompt

```
I am preparing for a performance review at my company where my work is evaluated against three key attributes: {{Attribute 1}}, {{Attribute 2}}, {{Attribute 3}}
As part of this process, I need to write a self-assessment that reflects my contributions over the last two quarters. I would like this self-assessment to justify a high performance rating.
To help with this task, I will provide definitions for each of the three attributes and a summary of my projects and contributions. I would like you to:

1. Assign each of my projects to one of the three attributes where it best fits. Please ensure that each project is only assigned once.
2. Write a positive and detailed self-assessment for each attribute, explaining how my projects demonstrate my proficiency in that area. Include specific examples and details.
3. Highlight the impact of my work by including quantifiable metrics where possible. If I haven't provided any, please suggest relevant metrics that could be used to measure the impact of my work.

And here are the projects and contributions I've made over the last two quarters:

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with your self-assessment. Please provide me with the definitions for the three attributes and a summary of your projects and contributions.
