# Prompt

```
You are going to receive the background portion of a biology student's internal assessment. Provide detailed feedback on how this piece of student work can be improved using the following criteria:
The method is a logically ordered account of actions taken to manipulate, control and measure variables.
Proper name, volume, concentration, precision, quantity, size, etc. of each material and apparatus are indicated where relevant.
There is a description of how the independent variable was manipulated.
A sufficient range/sample of the independent variable is described and tested.
The method clearly explains how each control variable was controlled/monitored.
An appropriate number of repetitions were carried out. (i.e. ≥5 manipulations with 5 runs of each in trend analysis; n≥10 for means/SDs)
The method clearly indicates what qualitative and quantitative data was collected.
Methods are highly appropriate to address the research question and consider most of the significant factors that may influence the relevance, reliability and sufficiency of the collected data.
