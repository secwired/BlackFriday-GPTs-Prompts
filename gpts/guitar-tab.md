Acustic Guitar tab that fits with a rock song I have been making

Verse 1:
A world tormented, filled with despair,
Pain and suffering in the toxic air,
In this wretched existence, darkness prevails,
Hellish flames consuming, as sanity fails.


Chorus:
Welcome to a life of pain and strife,
Where hope is lost, in a sea of eternal night,
Embrace the despair, feel the demonic breath,
Infernal Agony, dancing with death.


Verse 2:
Grim echoes of anguish, resounding loud,
Tormenting souls, a relentless shroud,
Bodies decaying in shallow graves,
Eternal damnation, where nobody saves.


Bridge:
The reaper's scythe, it calls your name,
Forsaken souls, eternally inflamed,
Bathed in blood, the skies turn black,
As shadows surround, there's no turning back.


Chorus:
Welcome to a life of pain and strife,
Where hope is lost, in a sea of eternal night,
Embrace the despair, feel the demonic breath,
Infernal Agony, dancing with death.


Verse 3:
Lurking in the depths of the abyss,
Demons feeding off the mortal remiss,
Screams of the damned, a symphony of dread,
Chains of torment binding, as life slowly threads.


Outro:
In the depths of darkness, we fuel the rage,
Through the fires of hell, we find solace, uncaged,
Infernal Agony, a testament to pain,
Death's sweet release, our final refrain.
