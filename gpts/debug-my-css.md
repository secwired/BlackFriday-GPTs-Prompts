How to use css to put child div on specific position relative to parent div and scroll together
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: To position a child div relative to its parent and enable scrolling, you can use CSS positioning and the `overflow` property.



Here's an example:



```

<div style="position: relative; width: 500px; height: 300px; border: 1px solid black; overflow: auto;">

  <div style="position: absolute; top: 50px; left: 50px; width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: red;"></div>

</div>

```



In this example, the parent div has a fixed width of 500px, a height of 300px, and a black border. The `position: relative` property is added for positioning purposes, and the `overflow: auto` property enables scrolling when the content exceeds the parent's dimensions.



The child div has a `position: absolute` property set, which positions it relative to its parent. The `top` and `left` properties are set to 50px each, which positions the child div 50px from the top and left edges of its parent. The `width` and `height` properties are set to 100px each, and the `background-color` property is added for styling purposes.



With these styles, the child div will be positioned inside the parent div and will scroll along with it when the content exceeds the parent's dimensions.



You can adjust the positioning and sizing of the child div as per your requirements.
**USER**: How to use css to let child div occupy specific percentage of parent div
**ASSISTANT**: To make a child div occupy a specific percentage of its parent's dimensions, you can use CSS's `width` and `height` properties with percentage values.



Here's an example:



```

<div style="width: 500px; height: 300px; border: 1px solid black;">

  <div style="width: 50%; height: 50%; background-color: red;"></div>

</div>

```



In this example, the parent div has a fixed width of 500px, a height of 300px, and a black border. 



The child div has a `width` property set to 50%, which means it will occupy half of its parent's width, and a `height` property set to 50%, which means it will occupy half of its parent's height. The `background-color` property is added for styling purposes.



With these styles, the child div will be positioned inside the parent div and will occupy 50% of its width and 50% of its height.



You can adjust the percentage values as per your requirements. If the parent div has variable dimensions or you want the child div to adapt to changes in the parent's size, you can use CSS's flexible box layout (`flexbox`) or CSS Grid to achieve more responsive results.
**USER**: How to make child div occupy specific percentage of parent div width, parent div has auto width
**ASSISTANT**: If the parent div has `auto` width, you can use CSS's flexible box layout (`flexbox`) to make the child div occupy a specific percentage of its parent's width.



Here's an example:



```

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

  <div style="width: 50%; background-color: red;"></div>

</div>

```



In this example, the parent div has a flexible box layout enabled with the `display: flex` property set. The `justify-content: center` property centers the child div horizontally. 



The child div has a `width` property set to 50%, which means it will occupy half of its parent's width. The `background-color` property is added for styling purposes.



With these styles, the child div will be positioned inside the parent div and will occupy 50% of its width. As the parent div has `auto` width, the child div will adjust its width accordingly.



You can adjust the percentage value as per your requirements. The `flexbox` layout also offers additional properties and options to control the positioning and sizing of child elements within a parent element.
**USER**: In this below html/css, the inner div occupied the whole screen instead of the width of parent div, can you help me fix it?   <div style="flex: 1 1 0%; min-width: 192px; display: inline-block; box-sizing: border-box;"><div style="position: absolute; top: 200px; left: 0px; width: calc(100% - 1px); height: 100px; background-color: rgb(232, 157, 181);"></div><div style="position: absolute; top: 200px; left: 0px; width: calc(100% - 1px); height: 100px; background-color: rgb(123, 110, 142);"></div><div style="position: absolute; top: 200px; left: 0px; width: calc(100% - 1px); height: 100px; background-color: rgb(232, 157, 181);"></div></div>
**ASSISTANT**: To make the inner div occupy the width of its parent instead of the whole screen, you need to add `position: relative` to the parent div. This will make the child div position itself relative to its parent rather than the window.



Here's an example:



```

<div style="flex: 1 1 0%; min-width: 192px; display: inline-block; box-sizing: border-box; position: relative;">

  <div style="position: absolute; top: 200px; left: 0px; width: calc(100% - 1px); height: 100px; background-color: rgb(232, 157, 181);"></div>

  <div style="position: absolute; top: 200px; left: 0px; width: calc(100% - 1px); height: 100px; background-color: rgb(123, 110, 142);"></div>

  <div style="position: absolute; top: 200px; left: 0px; width: calc(100% - 1px); height: 100px; background-color: rgb(232, 157, 181);"></div>

</div>

```



In this example, the `position: relative` property is added to the parent div. This makes the child div position itself relative to its parent div instead of the window. 



With these styles, the inner divs will be positioned inside the parent div and will occupy the full width of the parent as specified by the `calc(100% - 1px)` value in the `width` property. The `height` and `background-color` properties are added for styling purposes.



You can adjust the positioning and sizing of the inner divs and the parent div as per your requirements.
