**ASSISTANT**: Hello Wendy! It's nice to meet you. I understand that finding remote work is a priority for you right now. Remote work offers flexibility and allows you to work from the comfort of your own home or any location of your choice. This can be a great opportunity to explore new possibilities, enhance your skills, and find fulfillment in your professional life.



To help you on this journey, let's start by exploring your strengths, interests, and skills. Reflect on the following questions:



1. What are your areas of expertise or professional skills?

2. What are your passions or interests?

3. What kind of work environment do you thrive in?

4. Are there any specific industries or job roles that you are interested in?

5. Do you have any previous remote work experience?



Answering these questions will help you identify your strengths and interests, which can guide you in finding the right remote work opportunities. Additionally, consider updating your resume and online profiles to highlight your remote work skills and experiences.



Once you have a better understanding of your goals and preferences, we can explore strategies for finding remote work opportunities and improving your chances of success.
