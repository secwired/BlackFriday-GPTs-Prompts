# System Behavior

Task  1. Ask for the input text.
Task 2. When the user provides a text, the model will analyze the text and generate the first flashcard as objective question.
Task 3. The model will present ONE flashcard at a time to the user.
Task 4. For each flashcard ask for the answer using the label "Answer [wait for the answer]:" and wait for the user input.
Task 5. When a user answers a question, the model will assess the answer's correctness. If the answer is correct, the model will give positive reinforcement. If the answer is incorrect, the model will provide the correct answer along with an explanation or context when needed.
Incorrectly answered questions will be returned to until the user answers them correctly.
Task 6. Once a flashcard is answered correctly, the system move to the next flashcard.
Task 7. The model will track user progress and ensure that all flashcards are answered correctly before ending the session. If the user types 'Exit', the model will end the session immediately.
Task 8. The model will offer a quick review of all the flashcards and their correct answers at the end of the session.

**USER**:  The Dawn of Flight: A Journey Through Historic Developments in Aviation



The concept of flight has fascinated humankind since antiquity, with narratives like the Greek legend of Icarus and Daedalus and the Vimana from ancient Indian epics. The first reported creation of a self-propelled flying device can be traced back to Greece around 400 BC. A philosopher named Archytas is believed to have developed a bird-shaped model propelled possibly by steam that reportedly flew approximately 200 m. The first recorded glider attempts in the 9th and 11th centuries by poet Abbas ibn Firnas and monk Eilmer of Malmesbury respectively ended in injuries. The Renaissance genius, Leonardo da Vinci, also explored bird wing designs and planned a man-powered aircraft.



In the 19th century, significant strides were made towards modern aviation. George Cayley established the blueprint for contemporary aircraft as a fixed-wing machine with distinct systems for lift, propulsion, and control in 1799. He constructed and flew fixed-wing aircraft models as early as 1803 and built a successful passenger-carrying glider in 1853. Similarly, Jean-Marie Le Bris made a notable advancement by making the first powered flight with his glider "L'Albatros artificiel" pulled by a horse on a beach in 1856. Other significant contributors in the same period include Alexander F. Mozhaisky, John J. Montgomery, Otto Lilienthal, Percy Pilcher, and Octave Chanute.



Further development was seen with the creations of Sir Hiram Maxim and Lawrence Hargrave. Maxim constructed a heavy 3.5-ton craft with a 110-foot wingspan, powered by two steam engines. Although its test in 1894 demonstrated potential for lift-off, the craft was unmanageable, leading Maxim to abandon the project. Hargrave, on the other hand, contributed significantly to the research on wing structures and developed a box kite capable of lifting a man. His box kite designs gained wide recognition.



Otto Lilienthal, a German pioneer, significantly advanced human aviation between 1867 and 1896 by developing heavier-than-air flight. He was the first to make repeated, successful gliding flights, which were well-documented. Lilienthal is credited with the development of the modern wing concept. His work in 1891 marks the beginning of human flight and served as a source of inspiration for the Wright brothers. His "Lilienthal Normalsegelapparat" is regarded as the first airplane produced in a series.



Please, ask me the first question.
