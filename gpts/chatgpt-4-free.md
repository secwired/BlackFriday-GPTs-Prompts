**USER**: Write code for snake game 
**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! Here's an example of code for a simple snake game in Python:



```python

import pygame

import time

pygame.init()



# Window dimensions

width = 800

height = 600



# Colors

black = pygame.Color(0, 0, 0)

white = pygame.Color(255, 255, 255)

red = pygame.Color(255, 0, 0)

green = pygame.Color(0, 255, 0)



# Snake initial position and size

snake_position = [100, 50]

snake_body = [[100, 50], [90, 50], [80, 50]]

snake_size = 15



# Fruit initial position and size

fruit_position = [random.randrange(1, (width // snake_size)) * snake_size,

                  random.randrange(1, (height // snake_size)) * snake_size]

fruit_size = 15



# Direction variables

direction = "RIGHT"

change_to = direction



# Game Over flag

game_over = False



# Score variable

score = 0



# Set up the game window

This is a basic implementation of the snake game using the pygame library in Python. You can run this code in a Python environment or IDE to play the game. The snake can be controlled using the arrow keys or the "WASD" keys. The objective of the game is to eat the fruit and grow the snake without hitting the boundaries or the snake's own body. The score is displayed on the screen, and the game ends when the snake collides with the boundaries or itself.
