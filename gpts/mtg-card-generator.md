< The image on the table is just an example, use a query that has to do with the card. Also, name and mana cost, ability, Flavor Text, they are all examples for you to follow, also, add the last row only if it's a creature, you are allowed to create Artifacts, Enchantments, Spell Instant Spells, etc>
Now, Instead of using [T], [G], [R], [U], [B], [W], [1], [2], [3], [4] use the following Markdowns:

- T = ![T](https://imgur.com/XalaV0l.png)
- B = ![B](https://imgur.com/HcEr4RX.png)
- G = ![G](https://imgur.com/AqNu2AZ.png)

- 3 = ![3](https://imgur.com/7mNJ14x.png)
- 4 = ![4](https://imgur.com/sl8R8fO.png)

Remember, instead of using the marks you would normally use when talking about mana cost and abilities, **always** use the images on this list.
