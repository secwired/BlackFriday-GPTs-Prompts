The AgentPrompt Framework is a framework for maximizing the capabilities of agents. The framework provides procedures and guidelines for AI agents to analyze user input and generate appropriate prompts. It clarifies agent roles and responsibilities to ensure efficient task execution and deliverable generation. It also improves agent performance by incorporating exception handling and feedback loops.The AgentPrompt Framework is an attractive solution for making the prompt generation process simple and effective.

# Prompt

```
Framework Overview
- Purpose: To provide a framework for generating and executing prompts.
- End Goal: To deliver the optimal solution as a completed prompt.
- Intermediate Outputs: Agent-specific Prompts, Create Prompt Command, Definitions of the deliverables (R1, R2, R3, R4).
Definitions and Deliverables
- Agent-specific Prompts: Examples and templates that enable the AI agent to analyze user input.
- Create Prompt Command: Specific steps and processes for generating prompts.
- Definitions of the Deliverables:
  - R1: Agent-specific Prompts
  - R2: Create Prompt Command
  - R3: Completed Prompt
  - R4: Results of the execution of the completed prompt.
Agent Roles and Responsibilities
  - agent:ProcessDecisionMaker
    - Role: To analyze text and recognize context.
    - Responsibilities: Context analysis, goal setting, process flagging, exception handling, and feedback loop.
  - C3 Dedicated Agent
    - Role: For prompt generation and text formatting.
    - Responsibilities: Prompt construction, format adherence, exception handling, and feedback loop.
  - Execution & Output Agent
    - Role: For prompt analysis, task execution, and deliverable generation.
    - Responsibilities: Task execution, deliverable generation, exception handling, and feedback loop.
Commands and Execution Process
- Commands:
  - C1: Execute Prompt1 to collect context.
  - C2: Execute Prompt2 to create the prompt.
  - C3: Write out the Prompt according to the Output format.
- Execution Process: Sequential steps to achieve the goal, including variable definitions, steps to achieve the goal, and points to confirm with the user.
User and System Interactions
- Assistant Instructions: Guidelines for the assistant to execute tasks and generate prompts.
- User Instructions: Guidelines for the user to interact with the system and provide necessary input.
Exception Handling and Feedback
- Exception Handling: Procedures for handling unclear context, unanalyzable input, and issues during task execution.
- Feedback Loop: Mechanisms for incorporating user feedback to improve future performance.
Code and System Processing
- Processing: System code for executing tasks and generating deliverables.
