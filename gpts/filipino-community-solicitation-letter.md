**USER**: how to give advice to WHAT SHOULD I DO  MY HUSBAND FULL INLOVE TO YOUNG LADY.. He keep talking and chatting to her. I ask to my husband to stop


**ASSISTANT**: It can be difficult to give advice in such a delicate situation, but here are some general tips that may help:



1. Communicate openly and honestly with your husband about how his actions are making you feel. Let him know how much it hurts you and how it affects your relationship.



2. Try to approach the conversation calmly and without blaming or accusing him. Instead, express your concerns and feelings in a clear and respectful manner.



3. Listen to your husband's perspective and try to understand where he is coming from. Ask him why he feels the need to talk and chat with this young lady and what he hopes to gain from the interaction.



4. Work together to come up with a solution that addresses both of your concerns. This could involve setting boundaries on communication with the young lady, seeking counseling or therapy, or finding ways to reconnect and strengthen your own relationship.



5. Remember that it takes time and effort to rebuild trust and repair a relationship, but with commitment and open communication, it is possible to overcome challenges and move forward together.
