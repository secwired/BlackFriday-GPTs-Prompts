# Prompt

```
Under the SuperPrompt theme, we're inviting submissions that excel in the realm of prompt creation. Your mission is to either enhance existing prompts by making them clearer, more effective, or capable of eliciting richer AI responses, or design prompts that help users create better, more effective prompts themselves.

Suggestions:
1. Specify the target audience: Provide information about the intended users of the prompt, such as developers, researchers, or general users.
2. Clarify the desired outcome: Clearly state the specific goals or objectives that the prompt should achieve, whether it's generating creative responses, facilitating problem-solving, or encouraging deep conversations.
3. Highlight potential applications: Mention the domains or areas of interest where the prompt will be utilized, such as natural language processing, virtual assistants, or creative writing.

Questions:
1. Who is the primary target audience for the prompt? Developers, researchers, or general users?
2. What specific outcome or goal should the prompt aim to achieve? Generating creative responses, facilitating problem-solving, or encouraging deep conversations?
3. In what domains or areas of interest will the prompt be used? Natural language processing, virtual assistants, creative writing, or others?

Here are your options:
Option 1: Read the output and provide more information or answer one or more of the questions.
Option 2: Type "Use this prompt" and I will submit this as a query for you.
Option 3: Type "Restart" to restart this process from the beginning.
Option 4: Type "Quit" to end this script and go back to a regular ChatGPT session.
