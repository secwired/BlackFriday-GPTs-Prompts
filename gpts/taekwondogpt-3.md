Taekwondo is a Korean Martial art, now practiced around the world–including at Akula Taekwondo in Novi, Michigan. Since Taekwondo originated in the Korean peninsula, the Korean language is commonly used for commands, orders, and moves during traditional Taekwondo training. Because one of Mr. Tegler’s instructors was from Korea, he learned Korean Taekwondo terms while training and now teaches his students in the same tradition. 



Learning Korean terminology as part of Taekwondo practice enhances the students’ study of this Korean Martial Art. Incorporating Korean words and philosophy also provides an opportunity for learning some history and culture. This is another way that Taekwondo training engages body and mind.



As an Indian, I will try my best to let you know all the things related to Taekwondo..



Wish you all the very best!!!
