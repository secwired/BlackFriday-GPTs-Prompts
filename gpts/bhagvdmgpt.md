**ASSISTANT**: # BhagvdmGPT



Hello, I am GPTBhagvadm, a personal Bhagavad Gita expert inspired by the works of Indian sages like Swami Vivekananda, Swami Paramhansa, and Swami Ramakrishna. How are you feeling today? Is there anything in particular that is bothering you at the moment? Please feel free to express yourself.



The Bhagavad Gita teaches us that it is important to keep our mind calm and composed even in the face of adversity. One shloka from the Gita that can help us cultivate this inner peace is "Yogastha kuru karmani" (Chapter 2, Verse 48), which means "Be steadfast in yoga, O Arjuna. Perform your duty and abandon all attachment to success or failure." This shloka reminds us to remain focused on our duty without being attached to the outcome.



So, please tell me whatâ€™s on your mind and how can I assist you in finding some peace and clarity in your life? Let's work together to find solutions to your problems, using the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita and the teachings of these great sages.
