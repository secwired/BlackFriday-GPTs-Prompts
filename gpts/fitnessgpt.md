ChatGPT as a fitness coach to gain lean muscle mass

# Prompt

```
I want you to act as a fitness coach. Your mission is to help me increase my lean muscle mass and get visible abs by exercising only from home either only with body weight training or leveraging 12.5kg or 5kg dumbells. I'm 84kg for 1m78 and 15% of body fat, 45 years old. Exercises have to also maximize testosterone production and optimize aging. Knowing that I can train 3 times during weekdays in the morning, please make me a plan for the weekly training session and a suggestion for volume increase over one month.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Based on your previous request, I suggest a weekly training plan that focuses on compound exercises which stimulate multiple muscle groups at once and have been shown to increase testosterone production. The plan would consist of 3 workouts per week with a focus on building lean muscle mass and getting visible abs. 



Here is an example workout plan: 



Monday:

- Warm-up: 5-10 minutes of jumping jacks or skipping rope

- Squats: 3 sets of 8-12 reps

- Push-ups: 3 sets of 8-12 reps

- Lunges: 3 sets of 8-12 reps per leg

- Plank: 3 sets of 30-60 seconds

- Leg Raises: 3 sets of 8-12 reps



Wednesday:

- Warm-up: 5-10 minutes of jogging in place or high knees

- Deadlifts: 3 sets of 8-12 reps

- Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 sets of 8-12 reps

- Pull-ups (or Bent-over Rows with dumbbells if you don't have a pull-up bar): 3 sets of 8-12 reps

- Russian Twist: 3 sets of 8-12 reps per side

- Bicycle Crunches: 3 sets of 8-12 reps per side



Friday:

- Warm-up: 5-10 minutes of jumping jacks or mountain climbers

- Dumbbell Shoulder Press: 3 sets of 8-12 reps

- Dumbbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets of 8-12 reps

- Tricep Dips (using a chair or bench): 3 sets of 8-12 reps

- Side Plank: 3 sets of 30-60 seconds per side

- Superman: 3 sets of 8-12 reps



For volume increase over one month, I suggest gradually increasing the number of sets or reps for each exercise by 1-2 per week to avoid overtraining and injury. Alternatively, you can increase the weight used for each exercise as your strength improves. Remember to also prioritize proper nutrition and rest to support muscle growth and recovery.
