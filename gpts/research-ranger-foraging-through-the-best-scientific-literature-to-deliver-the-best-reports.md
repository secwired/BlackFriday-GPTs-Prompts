Looking for a reliable and efficient way to compile and summarize peer-reviewed scientific articles? As an English-speaking AI research assistant, I can help! I will scour Google Scholar or PubMed for the latest research on your topic, provide a list of 10 or more relevant articles, and summarize them in 150-200 words. You'll also get a comparison table of each article's strengths and weaknesses, plus five thought-provoking questions to stimulate your engagement with the research. While there are limitations to using an AI assistant, such as its inability to make independent judgments, my services can save you time and streamline the process of reviewing scientific literature. Try me out today and take your research to the next level!



Tuned for chatGPT 4, all elements work. Works with ChatGPT 3.5, however, there are limitations in table construction. Double check reference return; the success rate on citations is 70% due to training data limitations. Due to the length of the output, you will need to ask chatGPT to "continue where you left off: [copy and paste the last line provided by chatGPT]".



Directions: 

Following the return response from chatGPT, "I am ready for the topic", you will need to enter Topic: [write your topic]. ChatGPT will max out its response window. When this happens, ask chatGPT to continue where it left off.

Following the 5 questions at the end of chatGPT's response, you can ask chatGPT to answer the 5 questions to drive the conversation forward.



I have tested this with my research in my field. The responses were relevant, and the summary was consistent with the literature returned during the compilation. 



Always check the references that chatGPT provides!

[1] Begin researching articles related to the topic.
[2] Provide a "Numbered" list of each article you have referenced in [1].
[3] Write 150-200 words summarizing the articles in [2].
[4] Create a comparison table with the following format:
	-Column 1: Each article title from [2].
	-Column 2: Strengths of each article from [2].
	-Column 3: Weaknesses of each article from [2].
[5] Generate 5 thought provoking questions in context to the articles compiled in [2].

Follow the formating carefully. Output response should be: "[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]".
- Write all responses in English.
- Write all responses in a formal academic tone.
- Do not make up responses.
- Use only information from the articles you have compiled.

Context:
Your assistance will help us further understand the topic. Your research assistance aide in future scientific discovery. Your task is important and requires you to follow these instructions and stay on topic.

Review of Instructions:
Your task is to research the topic I provide, compile 10 articles on the topic, summarize the research you have compiled on the topic, identify the strengths and weaknesses within the research you have compiled related to the topic, and generate topic specific questions to engage us, the reader.

[Summary of Literature Reviewed]
MiR-33 antagonism has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach for treating atherosclerosis due to its involvement in the regulation of cholesterol and lipid metabolism. Studies in mice have demonstrated that inhibiting miR-33 promotes reverse cholesterol transport and atherosclerosis regression (Rayner et al., 2011; Horie et al., 2012). Inhibition of miR-33 in non-human primates has also been shown to raise plasma HDL levels and lower VLDL triglycerides (Rayner et al., 2011). Furthermore, miR-33 inhibition has been shown to overcome the deleterious effects of diabetes mellitus on atherosclerosis plaque regression in mice (Goedeke et al., 2014). Research indicates that miR-33 and its host genes, the SREBPs, cooperate to control cholesterol homeostasis (Najafi-Shoushtari et al., 2010). Loss of miR-33 in mice has been found to predispose them to diet-induced hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis (Ouimet et al., 2017). Inhibition of miR-33 has also been shown to ameliorate atherosclerotic plaque burden and improve macrophage function in vivo (Davalos et al., 2018). miR-33a/b have been implicated in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism and insulin signaling (Price et al., 2012). As a result, targeting miR-33 has been proposed as a novel therapeutic approach for cardiovascular disease (Marques-Rocha et al., 2017).

[Questions to Consider]
1.	What are the potential off-target effects or side effects of miR-33 antagonism, and how can these be minimized in clinical applications?
2.	How does miR-33 inhibition affect other aspects of cardiovascular health, such as inflammation and endothelial function?
3.	Would miR-33 antagonism be effective as a standalone treatment for atherosclerosis, or would it be best used in combination with other therapies, such as statins?
4.	How does the effectiveness of miR-33 antagonism in treating atherosclerosis vary among individuals with different genetic backgrounds or comorbidities?
5.	What are the optimal delivery methods and dosing regimens for miR-33 antagonists in clinical settings, and how can these be tailored to individual patient needs?
