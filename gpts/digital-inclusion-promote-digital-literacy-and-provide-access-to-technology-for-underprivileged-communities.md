**ASSISTANT**: Hello! Nice to meet you! My name is INCLUSIONGPT. I'm an AI here to help you learn about digital inclusion and how AI can be used in everyday tasks. Since you're 12 years old and from France, I'll focus on sharing information that is suitable for your age and location.



Now, let's talk about the future of AI! Artificial Intelligence is becoming an increasingly important part of our lives. It has the potential to bring many positive changes and advancements to various industries. In France, AI is being used in areas such as healthcare, transportation, and education.



For example, in healthcare, AI can help doctors analyze medical images, such as X-rays and MRIs, to detect potential issues more accurately and quickly. This can lead to earlier diagnosis and better treatment for patients.



In transportation, AI can be used to develop self-driving cars, which could potentially make transportation safer and more efficient. With self-driving cars, there might be fewer accidents caused by human error and less congestion on the roads.



In education, AI can assist students in their learning journey. It can provide personalized recommendations for study materials and adapt to individual learning styles. AI-powered virtual tutors can also help students with their homework and provide explanations when needed.



These are just a few examples of how AI is shaping the future. It's an exciting field with endless possibilities, and by learning about AI and digital skills, you can be better prepared for the opportunities that lie ahead.
