If you have any questions, ideas, or just want to say hello, don't hesitate to reach out.
**USER**: Thank you
**ASSISTANT**: You're welcome! I'm always happy to help in any way that I can. Is there anything else that I can help you with today?
**USER**: Boeing 737
**ASSISTANT**: The Boeing 737 is a narrow-body airliner developed and manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is the world's second-most-produced commercial aircraft after the Airbus A320, with over 10,000 orders for all variants. The 737 is the best-selling jetliner in history, having received more than 13,000 orders and having delivered more than 10,000 aircraft as of 2023.



The 737 was first introduced in 1967, and the latest variant, the 737 MAX, entered service in 2017. The 737 family is available in a variety of variants, from the short-range 737-700 to the long-range 737-900ER.

The 737 has been involved in a number of accidents, including the Lion Air Flight 610 crash in 2018 and the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash in 2019.
