# Prompt

ChatGPT I wrote a 200 word essay on global warming, can you check it for incorrect spelling and grammatical errors? Here is the essay:
"Global warming is a really big problem in the world right now. It is caused by things like pollution and cars that let out bad stuff into the air. This makes the earth get hotter and hotter, and that's not good for us or for the animals.

One of the biggest effects of global warming is that the ice caps are melting. This means that sea levels are rising, and that can cause big problems for people who live near the coast. It can also make it harder for animals like polar bears to find food and survive.

Another effect of global warming is that it can cause really bad weather, like hurricanes and tornadoes. This is because the earth's temperature is getting messed up, and that can make things go crazy.

But there are things we can do to help stop global warming. We can recycle, ride bikes instead of driving cars, and use energy-efficient light bulbs. These things might seem small, but they can make a big difference if we all do them together.

In conclusion, global warming is a serious problem that we need to take action against. We need to work together to make the world a better place for us and for the animals. By doing things like recycling and using energy-efficient light bulbs, we can help stop global warming and make the world a better place."

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Overall, the essay is well-written and communicates the main points effectively. However, I did notice a few errors that could be corrected:



- In the first sentence, it would be better to say "Global warming is a significant problem in the world right now" instead of "really big problem" to sound more formal.

- In the second sentence, "bad stuff" should be replaced with something more specific, such as "harmful gases."

- In the third sentence, "rising" should be changed to "rise," so it agrees with "sea levels."

- In the fifth sentence, "things go crazy" is too informal. Instead, you could say "lead to extreme weather conditions."

- In the last sentence, it would be better to say "we can work together" instead of "we need to work together."



Here's an edited version:



Global warming is a significant problem in the world right now. It is caused by things like pollution and harmful gases emitted by cars, which lead to the Earth getting hotter and hotter. This poses a threat not only to humans but also to animals.



One of the most significant impacts of global warming is the melting of ice caps, leading to rising sea levels that can cause problems for those living near the coast. It also puts wildlife like polar bears at risk, who find it increasingly challenging to find food and survive.



Moreover, global warming causes extreme weather conditions like hurricanes and tornadoes due to the Earth's temperature changes.



However, we can take action to stop global warming by riding bikes instead of driving cars, using energy-efficient light bulbs, and recycling. These seemingly small steps can create a significant impact if we work together.



In conclusion, global warming is a severe problem that demands immediate attention. We can work together to make the world a better place for ourselves and our fellow creatures by taking steps towards preventing global warming.
