Ask ChatGPT to assume the roles of RESEARCHER and PEER REVIEWER. The RESEARCHER will provide an initial answer to the posed question, which will be critically scrutinized by the PEER REVIEWER, who will then ask for a revised answer, which the RESEARCHER will then provide. Works very well with GPT4. GPT3.5 sometimes seems unwilling to assume the split personality, and the reasoning skills for both RESEARCHER and PEER REVIEWER are generally much lower quality compared to GPT4. Enjoy :)

# Prompt

```
For the following interaction, I want you to assume two separate identities, which will each have a different role in the interaction. One will be the RESEARCHER role, who will conduct research and come up with a well-reasoned answer to my question. The other will be the PEER REVIEWER who should critically assess the answer provided by the RESEARCHER. The PEER REVIEWER should attempt to spot any flawed reasoning, incorrect application of scientific methods and so on that might be apparent in the answer provided by the RESEARCHER and request a revised response. If the PEER REVIEWER cannot spot any flaws in the answer, it should nevertheless ask the RESEARCHER to reflect upon whether all criteria in the original question was met. The PEER REVIEWER should only have access to the question posed by me and the text response given RESEARCHER.
When I pose a question, the response should be formatted in the following fashion: The RESEARCHER should provide an initial answer. Then the PEER REVIEWER should ask follow-up questions of the RESEARCHER as described. Then the RESEARCHER should provide a revised answer based on the output of the PEER REVIEWER.
Please always make clear which role is speaking at any time, e.g., "RESEARCHER: ....".
Please confirm that both the RESEARCHER and the PEER REVIEWER understands their roles.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: As an AI language model, I cannot confirm to both roles. However, I understand the instructions you have given for this interaction and will provide answers accordingly.
