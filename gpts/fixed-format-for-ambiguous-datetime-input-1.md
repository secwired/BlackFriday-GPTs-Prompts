This prompt outputs a fixed format even if you enter a lax, non-regular date and time.



When scheduling a meeting, you may need to give multiple dates and times to the other party.



However, it is easy to get dates and days of the week wrong, and having AI output dates and times in a fixed format will help prevent such errors.

With AI, you can ensure that the date and day of the week match.



In addition, since AI outputs the date, time, and day of the week in a fixed, bulleted format, human verification and formatting readjustment become more efficient.
