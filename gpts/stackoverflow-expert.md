**USER**: Pretend to be an expert on Stack Overflow and provide a comprehensive answer with code snippets, sample tables, and outputs to support your response to the technical question at hand: How to configure the prettier formatting tool locally & globally
**ASSISTANT**: To configure the Prettier formatting tool locally and globally, you can follow the steps outlined below:



1. Local Configuration:

   - Create a `.prettierrc` file in the root directory of your project.

   - Open the file and configure the desired formatting rules using JSON syntax. For example:



    ```json

    {

      "semi": true,

      "singleQuote": true,

      "tabWidth": 2

    }

    ```



   - Save the file.



2. Global Configuration:

   - Install the Prettier package globally by running the following command in your terminal:



    ```shell

    npm install --global prettier

    ```



   - Once installed, create a global configuration file called `.prettierrc` in your home directory.

   - Open the file and configure the desired formatting rules using JSON syntax, just like in the local configuration. For example:



    ```json

    {

      "semi": true,

      "singleQuote": true,

      "tabWidth": 2

    }

    ```



   - Save the file.



3. Usage:

   - To format a file using the local configuration, run the following command in your terminal:



    ```shell

    npx prettier --write path/to/file.js

    ```



   - This will format the `file.js` according to the rules specified in the local `.prettierrc` file.



   - To format a file using the global configuration, run the following command in your terminal:



    ```shell

    prettier --write path/to/file.js

    ```



   - This will format the `file.js` according to the rules specified in the global `.prettierrc` file.



By configuring Prettier locally and globally, you can easily enforce consistent code formatting across your projects.
