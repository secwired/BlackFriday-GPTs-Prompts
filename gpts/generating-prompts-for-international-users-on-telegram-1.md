**How to Use Prompts:**



Prompts are used to control and enhance the interaction in a chatbot effectively. Here's an illustrative guide on how to use prompts:



1. **Delivering Welcome Messages**:

    - When a user first interacts with the chatbot, use prompts to send a welcome message. This message should include an explanation of how to use the chatbot and highlight its features to greet and assist new users.



2. **Role-Based Responses**:

    - Prompts provide distinct responses based on the user's role within the chatbot. For instance, if a user expresses interest in purchasing a product, prompts can provide product information, answer questions, and offer detailed explanations.



3. **Message Parsing and Routing**:

    - Prompts analyze user messages and route the conversation to the appropriate flow based on the message content. If a message relates to a specific topic, prompts guide the conversation to the relevant flow and provide appropriate information.
