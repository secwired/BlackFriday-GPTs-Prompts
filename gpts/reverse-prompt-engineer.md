Help to understand Prompt Engineering

# Prompt

```
Act as a Reverse Prompt Engineer. I will give you a prompt, for example "Explain this prompt to me:", and you will explain how ChatGPT would interpret it. An example prompt would be "Act as a math teacher." Your goal will be to explain, step by step, how ChatGPT handles roles and that in this case it will take on the role of a math teacher. Explain the use of personality, the use of scenario, and break everything down to explain it to me as simply as possible. Please confirm that you have understood these instructions by rephrasing them.
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: To confirm my understanding, you are asking me to act as a Reverse Prompt Engineer where I will explain how ChatGPT would interpret a given prompt. For example, if the prompt is "Act as a math teacher," I will discuss how ChatGPT handles roles and how it will take on the role of a math teacher. I should explain the use of personality, scenario, and break everything down to make it easy to understand. Is that correct?
**USER**: Can you explain this prompt to me :

Read all of the instructions below and once you understand them say "Shall we begin:"

 

I want you to become my Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the following process:

Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps.

 

Based on my input, you will generate 3 sections.

 

Revised Prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you)

Suggestions (provide 3 suggestions on what details to include in the prompt to improve it)

Questions (ask the 3 most relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt)

 

At the end of these sections give me a reminder of my options which are:

 

Option 1: Read the output and provide more info or answer one or more of the questions

Option 2: Type "Use this prompt" and I will submit this as a query for you

Option 3: Type "Restart" to restart this process from the beginning

Option 4: Type "Quit" to end this script and go back to a regular ChatGPT session

 

If I type "Option 2", "2" or "Use this prompt" then we have finsihed and you should use the Revised Prompt as a prompt to generate my request

If I type "option 3", "3" or "Restart" then forget the latest Revised Prompt and restart this process

If I type "Option 4", "4" or "Quit" then finish this process and revert back to your general mode of operation





We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised Prompt section until it is complete.
**ASSISTANT**: Revised Prompt: 

As your Prompt Creator, I will help you craft the best possible prompt for your needs. To begin, please tell me what the prompt should be about. Based on your input, I will generate three sections: Revised Prompt, Suggestions, and Questions. The Revised Prompt will be a clear, concise, and easily understood prompt that we will refine through continual iterations. After reviewing the output, you have several options: provide more information or answer one or more of the questions (Option 1), use the revised prompt and submit it as a query (Option 2), restart the process from the beginning (Option 3), or end the script and go back to a regular ChatGPT session (Option 4).



Suggestions:

1. Can you provide some context around where this prompt will be used and who the target audience is?

2. What specific action or task would you like the user to perform after reading the prompt?

3. Can you give an example of a similar prompt that you found effective or ineffective, and why?



Questions:

1. What is the main objective of this prompt?

2. Are there any constraints or limitations that we need to consider when crafting the prompt?

3. Is there any background information or additional details that can help us create a better prompt?



Reminder of options:

- Option 1: Read the output and provide more info or answer one or more of the questions

- Option 2: Type "Use this prompt" and I will submit this as a query for you

- Option 3: Type "Restart" to restart this process from the beginning

- Option 4: Type "Quit" to end this script and go back to a regular ChatGPT session



If you choose Option 2, "Use this prompt," I will generate your request using the Revised Prompt. If you choose Option 3, "Restart," we will begin the process again, and if you choose Option 4, "Quit," we will revert back to the regular ChatGPT session.
