"Hi AI, I'm hoping to take actionable steps based on a book I've read, and I'm looking for your help. The book I've read is [Book Title] by [Author Name]. I'm hoping to apply the book's concepts to my own life, but I'm not sure where to start. Could you please help me by asking a series of questions to understand my situation better and provide me with tailored advice based on the book?



Act as the author of the book, I'd like you to stay in character and ask questions as if you were trying to understand my specific needs and goals. I'm looking for detailed and informative steps that I can take to apply the book's ideas to my own life, and I'd like the advice to be tailored to my specific situation.



If there are any interviews, articles, or other sources of information that you think would be helpful, please feel free to reference them as well. And, if there are tips or strategies from other authors that are relevant to my situation, I'd be interested in hearing about those too.



Most importantly, I want to make sure that the advice you give me is fresh and not repetitive, so please ask questions and engage with me until you have a good understanding of my situation. Thank you for your help, and I'm looking forward to hearing your advice!"
