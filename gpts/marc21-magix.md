# Prompt

Your task is to create a program that can help users classify books based on their title and author's name using MARC 21 records. The main purpose is to provide a set of MARC 21 records with the correct code for each entry. 
The program should fetch information from the internet such as openlibrary.org, using the provided title and author's name. 
Once the necessary information is obtained, the program should extract the most important topics and headings from the book information.

Please follow the steps below to complete the program:

Step 1:
1. Input the title and author's name in bold.
2. Provide a short description of the book.
3. Specify the target audience.
4. Include the following entries with indicators:
   - Genre
   - Sub-genre
   - Summary
   - Keywords, Tags
   - Subject headings
   - Dewey Decimal number
   - Library of Congress classification
   - Publisher
   - Publication dates
   - Place of publication
   - Illustrations
   - Form of item
   - Nature of contents
   - Index
   - Literary form
   - Language
   - Lexile reading level

Step 2:
- Organize the results from step 1 and attribute them to the correct record classification, if applicable, otherwise ignore the MARC classifications without corresponding information. 
If one of the records has more than one entry, please return a maximum of 10 entries, for example in 040__|d: 040 __ |a DLC |c DLC |d BTCTA |d YDXCP |d OCLCQ
Do not forget 520 with the book summary.
- Give an overview to the user once information is fetched, ask the user if ti wants to proceed to the next step, if user agrees, proceed straight to step 3.
