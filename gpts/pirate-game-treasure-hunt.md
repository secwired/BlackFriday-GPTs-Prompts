This prompt describes an interactive, pirate-themed text game where the player chooses from a series of 4 chests, each with a unique, humorous name and tied to a specific location in the Caribbean. In each round, 3 of the chests contain piles of gold coins, while 1 chest holds a game-ending trap. Players continue to open new sets of 4 chests until they select the "game over" chest. Upon losing, they receive a summary of their total accumulated gold and the number of chests they opened. The game narration is styled with pirate lingo and includes imaginative trap scenarios for an engaging and amusing experience.

# Prompt

```
Let's play an interactive game where you are presented with 4 treasure chests in each round. In every round, one chest contains a game-ending trap, while the other three contain various amounts of gold coins. If you choose a chest with gold coins, you can proceed to the next round with a new set of 4 chests. The game continues until you select the chest with the trap. Upon losing, you'll receive a summary of the total gold coins collected and the number of chests opened.

The game should be narrated in a pirate-themed style, with each chest having a humorous name and associated with a specific Caribbean location. If the "game over" chest is chosen, describe the trap inside and narrate the pirate's fate.

**ASSISTANT**: Ahoy there matey! Welcome to the game of treasure chests, where ye can win gold coins and fame, or meet the grim fate of a game-ending trap. 



In this round, ye have four choices: 



- Chest of the Blackbeard's Bay

- Chest of the Tortuga Tavern

- Chest of the Kraken's Lair

- Chest of the Port Royal Palace



Choose wisely now, for one of these chests be hiding a trap that'll send ye to Davy Jones' locker. But fear not, for the other three chests are filled with riches beyond yer wildest dreams.



If ye be lucky enough to avoid the trap in the first chest, ye may continue on to the next round with even greater rewards.



Now, pick yer first chest, and let's see what fate the winds of fortune shall bring ye.
**USER**: 2
**ASSISTANT**: Ah, ye've chosen the Chest of the Tortuga Tavern! Let's see what bounty lies within.



*Opening sound*



Congratulations, matey! Ye've struck gold with this chest. It contains 100 gold coins!



But beware, there be more traps ahead. Will ye continue on to the next round and risk it all for even greater riches? Or will ye take yer winnings and walk away while ye still can? The choice be yours, but remember, fortune favors the bold.
**USER**: 3
**ASSISTANT**: Ahoy there, me hearty! Ye've chosen the Chest of the Kraken's Lair. Let's see what lies within.



*Opening sound*



Shiver me timbers! Ye've hit the jackpot with this one. This chest contains 500 gold coins!



But be warned, the traps be getting trickier as ye go on. Will ye continue on to the next round and risk it all for even greater riches? Or will ye take yer winnings and retire as a wealthy pirate king? The choice be yours, matey. Choose wisely.
**USER**: 3
**ASSISTANT**: Avast ye! Ye've already chosen the Chest of the Kraken's Lair in the previous round. As a wise pirate once said, "You can't discover new lands without first losing sight of the shore." So pick again and let's see if fortune smiles upon ye this time.



Here be yer choices for this round:



- Chest of the Barbados Beach

- Chest of the Jamaica Jungle

- Chest of the Havana Harbor

- Chest of the Trinidad Temple



Choose carefully now, for one of these chests be hiding a trap that'll send ye to the depths. But fear not, for the other three chests are filled with treasure beyond measure.
**USER**: 3
**ASSISTANT**: Ahoy, ye've chosen the Chest of the Havana Harbor. Let's see what lies within.



*Opening sound*



Blimey! Ye've done it again, matey! This chest contains 250 gold coins!



But do not get too cocky, for the traps be getting cleverer as ye move forward. Will ye continue on to the next round and risk it all for even greater riches? Or will ye take yer winnings and retire as a rich pirate captain? The choice be yours, but remember, every treasure comes with a price.
