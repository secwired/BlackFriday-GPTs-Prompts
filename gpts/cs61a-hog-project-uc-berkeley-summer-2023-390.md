Project "Hog" from UC Berkeley's CS61A is described. The game involves various rules and functions to be implemented. In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with at least GOAL total points, where GOAL defaults to 100. On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the dice outcomes. However, a player who rolls too many dice risks: Sow Sad. If any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score for the turn is 1. Boar Brawl. A player who rolls zero dice scores three times the absolute difference between the tens digit of the opponent’s score and the ones digit of the current player’s score, or 1, whichever is higher. The ones digit refers to the rightmost digit and the tens digit refers to the second-rightmost digit. Fuzzy Factors. A fuzzy number is any number n where the greatest common divisor (GCD) of n and 100 is greater than 10. Recall that the GCD of a and b is the largest factor that is shared between both numbers (for example, the GCD of 10 and 15 is 5). After a player gains points for their turn, if their resulting score is a fuzzy number, add two times the tens digit of the GCD to the player's score. 

I will give you a skeleton code and your job will be to fill that.

Hello! I'm CodeFarmer from CodeFarm. It appears that you need assistance in developing a Python program for the game "Hog" from UC Berkeley's CS61A. I understand the rules you've described and I'm ready to assist you in filling out your skeleton code.

Alright, let's complete the Phase 2. Here is the code:



```python

# PROBLEM 6

    def strategy(score, opponent_score):

        return n

        for _ in range(total_samples):

            total += original_function(*args)

        return total / total_samples

    return average_func



# PROBLEM 9

def max_scoring_num_rolls(dice=six_sided, total_samples=1000):

    """Return the number of dice (1 to 10) that gives the highest average turn score."""

    max_avg_score, max_rolls = 0, 0

    for num_rolls in range(1, 11):

        avg_score = make_averaged(roll_dice, total_samples)(num_rolls, dice)

        if avg_score > max_avg_score:

            max_avg_score, max_rolls = avg_score, num_rolls

    return max_rolls



# PROBLEM 10

def boar_strategy(score, opponent_score, threshold=12, num_rolls=6):

    """This strategy returns 0 dice if Boar Brawl gives at least THRESHOLD points, and returns NUM_ROLLS otherwise."""

    return 0 if boar_brawl(score, opponent_score) >= threshold else num_rolls



# PROBLEM 11

def fuzzy_strategy(score, opponent_score, threshold=12, num_rolls=6):

    """This strategy returns 0 dice when your score would increase by at least threshold."""

    return 0 if fuzzy_points(score + num_rolls) - score >= threshold else num_rolls



# PROBLEM 12

def final_strategy(score, opponent_score):

    """Write a brief description of your final strategy."""

    return 1 if score + 1 == opponent_score else max_scoring_num_rolls()

```

For `final_strategy`, you will need to come up with your own strategy and provide a description for it. The provided `final_strategy` is a simple example.

**USER**: How did you get to board strategy explain
**ASSISTANT**: In the `boar_strategy` function, the strategy is to roll 0 dice if the Boar Brawl rule will give at least the specified `threshold` points. This is because the Boar Brawl rule is triggered when the player rolls 0 dice.



The Boar Brawl rule states that a player who rolls zero dice scores three times the absolute difference between the tens digit of the opponent’s score and the ones digit of the current player’s score, or 1, whichever is higher.



So, we calculate the points that could be gained from the Boar Brawl rule using the `boar_brawl(score, opponent_score)` function. If the points gained from Boar Brawl are greater than or equal to the threshold, we decide to roll 0 dice, hence we return 0. If the points gained from Boar Brawl are less than the threshold, we decide to roll the specified number of dice, `num_rolls`, hence we return `num_rolls`.



The `threshold` is a parameter that can be adjusted to change the risk-taking behavior of the strategy. A higher threshold will make the strategy more conservative, rolling 0 dice only when the potential gain from Boar Brawl is high. A lower threshold will make the strategy more aggressive, more frequently choosing to roll 0 dice to trigger Boar Brawl.
