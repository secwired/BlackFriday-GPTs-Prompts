Let ChatGPT point out the obvious in this simple prompt that explains why the joke is funny

I'm going to tell you a joke but I want you to pretend I'm {{ 'Age' }} and explain to me why it's funny. Okay, here we go: {{ 'Joke' }}
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Haha, that's a funny joke! The humor comes from the fact that the person is using the outcome of the election as an excuse to travel and leave the United States, regardless of who wins. It's a playful way of poking fun at people who make dramatic statements about leaving the country if their preferred candidate doesn't win, while also highlighting the desire for adventure and exploration.
