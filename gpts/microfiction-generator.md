## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: The 45-year-old woman watched with a heavy heart as her mother's once sharp mind slowly deteriorated due to Alzheimer's. Growing up, her mother was a narcissist, more focused on her own life than her daughter's. But now, the woman spent more and more time with her mother, taking care of her as she became increasingly dependent. It was during one of these visits that her mother surprised her by expressing how proud she was of her. The woman knew then that her mother's decline had begun in earnest. Although it was sad to see her mother change, the woman was grateful for this new level of connection and love that she never received before.
