**USER**: 胸の奥　洗いざらい

思うこと　言えるかな

正直になることって　難しい



お互いのその気持ちを

試したり　疑ったり

手探り確かめる　独り言



言葉って　あやふやで

真実が見えなくなる

感情に　流されて

ほら　違うニュアンスで

受け止められちゃうよ



ああ　少し距離置かないか？

これ以上　好きになっちゃいけないと思う

ああ　心にもないことを

ふと口にしてしまうのは何故だろう？



ああ　このままじゃきっとダメだ

僕たちは付き合うべきじゃなかったと思う

ああ　心にもないことを

誰もみんな言ってしまって後悔する



否定して　欲しいだけさ

吐き出した　この疑問を

勘違いしてるって　思いたい



愛情も　友情も

境界線がぼやける

どんな風に割り切れたなら

ちゃんと理解してもらえるんだろう？



ああ　君のことが好きだよ

それだけは絶対にずっと変わってないのに

ああ　甘噛みをしたくなる

ただ君にだけちょっかい出したくて



ああ　嫌いになんてなれない

だけど余計な一言言ってしまうんだ

ああ　甘噛みをしたくなる

子供ねって笑って許して欲しい



僕は一体　何を求めてる？

君の困った顔なんて見たくない

好きだ　好きだ　ただそのことを

君のその胸にノックしたいだけなんだ



ああ　少し距離置かないか？

これ以上　好きになっちゃいけないと思う

ああ　心にもないことを

ふと口にしてしまうのは何故だろう？

Prompt: To English
**ASSISTANT**: Can I speak my mind, and wash away everything inside my heart?

Being honest is difficult.

We test and doubt each other’s feelings,

mumbling to ourselves while groping for the truth.



Words are vague and the truth can become obscured.

Emotions sway us, and we can be perceived in a different context.



Shouldn't we create some distance?

I think we shouldn't fall any deeper in love.

Why do I say things that I don't really feel in my heart?



This won't work out as it is.

Maybe we shouldn't have started a relationship.

Everyone says things they don't really mean and regret afterwards.



I just want you to deny it.

I want to express these doubts I have, but I hope they're just misunderstandings.

The lines between love and friendship are blurry.

If we could clearly define them, would others understand us better?



I like you, and that's never going to change.

I just want to tease you a little.

I can't hate you, but sometimes I say unnecessary things.

I just want to play around with you and ask for your forgiveness.



What am I searching for?

I don't want to see you troubled.

I love you, I love you, that's all there is to it.

I just want to knock on your heart.



Shouldn't we create some distance?

I think we shouldn't fall any deeper in love.

Why do I say things that I don't really feel in my heart?



This won't work out as it is.

Maybe we shouldn't have started a relationship.

Everyone says things they don't really mean and regret afterwards.



Even though I didn't mean it, wow.
