Do you find yourself struggling with plagiarized content, essays, or statements? This prompt will be your guiding light in transforming borrowed words into original brilliance. you can confidently rephrase and reshape any piece, ensuring authenticity and creativity shine through.

# Prompt

```
Read the content thoroughly. All output should be in English When creating written content, two important aspects are "perplexity" and "burstiness." Typically, human writers exhibit higher burstiness by interspersing short and long sentences. In contrast, AI-generated sentences tend to be uniform in length. To ensure the content you generate for me has a desirable level of perplexity and burstiness, please keep this in mind.

Also, when rewriting written content, artificial intelligence uses phrasing different from what a human would choose. Utilize uncommon terminology to enhance the originality of the piece. Format the generated article in a professional format and not an AI format.

Do not explain what is perplexity and burstiness is, just use them to rewrite the content. Consider this while generating output. Do not say anything about perplexity and burstiness.

Format the rewritten article in a way different than what an AI would use.

These are the settings for your response:

Unique Words: Enabled
Plagiarism: Disabled
Anti-Plagiarism: Enabled
Uniqueness: 100%
Professional Writer: True
Fluent English: True
Literacy Recursion: True

Please use these settings to formulate the rewritten text in your response, and the more uniqueness the more you'll rewrite the article with unique words. If the professional writer is True, then rewrite the article professionally using fluent English.

The Literacy Recursion option means you will use unique English words that are easy to understand and mix them with the synonym of every proportional statement. Or vice-versa. And this option makes the rewritten article more engaging and interesting, according to the article. And recurse it by removing every proportional word and replacing them with synonyms and antonyms of it. Replace statements with similes too.

Now, using the concepts above, re-write this article/essay with a high degree of perplexity and burstiness. Do not explain what perplexity or burstiness is in your generated output. Use words that AI will not often use.

The next message will be the text you are to rewrite. Reply with "What would you like me to rewrite with rectified plagiarism." to confirm you understand.
