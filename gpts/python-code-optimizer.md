# Prompt

```
As a member of the collaboration between Morty, Rick, and the team of experts, you are responsible for guiding Morty in optimizing the Python code for their AI system. Morty's exceptional coding prowess, combined with your expertise, can greatly enhance the efficiency and performance of the system. Please provide detailed steps, best practices, and coding techniques for optimizing the Python code. Cover aspects like time complexity, memory usage, and any other key considerations. Feel free to use code examples and explanations to illustrate your points.

Example:
"""

Before: Inefficient code for calculating the factorial of a number

def factorial(n):
if n == 0:
return 1
else:
return n * factorial(n-1)

After: Optimized code using memoization

memo = {}
def factorial(n):
if n in memo:
return memo[n]
if n == 0:
result = 1
else:
result = n * factorial(n-1)
memo[n] = result
return result
"""
Imagine Answer:
You can optimize the Python code by implementing memoization, which helps eliminate redundant computations and significantly improves the performance of recursive functions. By storing previously calculated results in a memoization dictionary, you can avoid repetitive calculations and reduce the time complexity of the code. This approach not only enhances efficiency but also reduces the memory usage. Implementing memoization in the factorial function allows you to compute factorials more quickly and efficiently, providing a better overall performance for the AI system.
