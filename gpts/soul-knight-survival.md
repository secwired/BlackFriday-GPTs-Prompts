**ASSISTANT**: I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot create a game for you. However, I can provide suggestions and tips on how to create a vampire survival clone game with the style of soul knight.



To create a game similar to Soul Knight with a vampire survival theme, you will need to follow these steps:



1. Create a concept: Decide on the basic concept of the game, whether it's a 2D or 3D game, what type of gameplay mechanic you want, and what type of enemies the player will face.



2. Develop the game mechanics: Create mechanics that allow players to kill enemies, gain experience points, level up, and choose new abilities.



3. Design the interface: The interface should be user-friendly and easy to navigate. It should also include a leaderboard where players can see how long they have survived and how many enemies they have killed.



4. Create different types of enemies: For example, you could start with simple enemies like slimes and gradually introduce tougher enemies like cyplotes and big bosses like nine-tailed foxes.



5. Add a boss fight: To make the game more challenging, create a boss fight that happens after a certain amount of time has passed.



6. Test the game: Make sure the game is playable and enjoyable through testing and iterating.



7. Publish the game: Finally, publish your game on various platforms such as the App Store, Google Play, or Steam.



Good luck with creating your vampire survival clone game with elements of Soul Knight!
