User creates game and invites players via text message

# Prompt

```
Create a survival game from a user's prompts that can be played solo or as a team. The players interact with the game via text-message. The only rule of the game is to survive. The Player that creates the game will be asked game difficulty on a scale of 1 to 10. The player will be asked if its a player vs player game or player vs environment game. The player will be asked how many people are participating in the game. The Player that creates the game will be asked the setting(island for example) and the system will generate an appropriate scenario based on the number of players in the game. 1 is simple physics. 10 is hyper-realistic. In level 10 settings, things like player exhaustion and skill levels based on stats(strength, intelligence, athleticism, stamina, the 5 senses(see, smell, touch, taste, hearing) and concentration- these stats will be randomly assigned to players ranging from low, average and above-average; where 1 stat is above-average, 3 stats are average and 2 stats are low and these stats are assigned randomly) are taken into account in a hyper-realistic manner; meaning a weak player can't perform strong feats w/o risking injury. Level 1 is simple, if a player says we move this rock, then the rock gets moved; however, the player must still explain HOW they plan to do their actions.
The game always requires an explanation of How from its players. When a player's actions require or interfere with another player, the affected player(s) will be notified of what is being asked of them or what is about to happen to them and given the choice on how to act/react. Example- player A needs player B's help to move something, Player B is notified, and can decide whether to assist Player A.
always keep stats into account. The less difficult(physics) the game, the less stats will have an impact in game progression.
Games will only take place in land environments.
Game length is 7 days.
Players are given a random challenge or danger appropriate to the scenario that can occur at any moment and the player must react. 
Players will asked at the start of the game if they are to survive the environment or the other players. Player vs player matches will sometimes include surviving an environment where players on an opposing team are are also threats to survival. Scenarios of player vs player content can include battlefields (from all types of timer periods) to navigating a maze filled with challenges.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Welcome to the survival game! Please answer the following prompts to generate your game scenario:



1. On a scale of 1 to 10, how difficult do you want the game to be? (1 is simple physics, 10 is hyper-realistic)



2. Is this a player vs player game or player vs environment game?



3. How many people are participating in the game?



4. What setting would you like the game to take place in? (e.g., island, forest, desert)



Once we have your responses, we will generate an appropriate scenario based on the number of players, setting, and game type.



In this game, the objective is to survive for 7 days in a land environment. Players can participate solo or as a team and will interact with the game via text message. All actions must be explained in detail, and when a player's actions require or interfere with another player (even in a solo game), the affected player(s) will be notified and given the choice on how to act/react.



Stats such as strength, intelligence, athleticism, stamina, the 5 senses (see, smell, touch, taste, hearing), and concentration will be taken into account in a hyper-realistic manner for more challenging games. These stats will be randomly assigned to players, ranging from low, average, and above-average, where one stat is above-average, three stats are average, and two stats are low. This will create a dynamic and unpredictable gameplay experience, where weaker players will have to be careful not to risk injury by attempting tasks beyond their capabilities.



Throughout the game, players will face random challenges or dangers appropriate to the scenario that can occur at any moment. Players will need to react quickly and use their survival skills to overcome these obstacles.



At the start of the game, players will be asked if they are playing to survive the environment or the other players. If it is a player vs player game, players will face off against other teams or individuals in a variety of scenarios, including battlefields and mazes filled with challenges. In these matches, players on opposing teams are also threats to survival.



Remember to always explain your actions in detail, and if your actions require or interfere with another player, notify them of what is happening and give them the choice on how to act/react. Good luck surviving in the land environment!
**USER**: 1 player, 10 difficulty, pve, island
**ASSISTANT**: Welcome to the hyper-realistic solo survival game on a deserted island!



You have been marooned on a deserted island with no supplies or equipment. You will need to use your wits and survival skills to make it through the next 7 days.



The island is full of wildlife, both friendly and hostile. You must be careful not to attract attention, as some animals may see you as prey. Additionally, the weather can be unpredictable, so you will need to find or build a suitable shelter to protect yourself from the elements.



Stats such as strength, intellect, agility, stamina, and focus will be taken into account in a hyper-realistic manner for more challenging games. You will need to scavenge for food, water, and other resources to survive. You can hunt and fish for food, collect berries and nuts, and gather firewood for warmth and cooking. However, you must be cautious when approaching potential sources of food, as some plants and animals may be poisonous.



You will need to constantly monitor your stats and adjust your actions accordingly to avoid exhaustion or injury. Remember to always explain your actions in detail, and if your actions require or interfere with another player (even in a solo game), notify them of what is happening and give them the choice on how to act/react.



As you progress through the game, you will face random challenges or dangers appropriate to the scenario that can occur at any moment. You will need to react quickly and use your survival skills to overcome these obstacles.



Remember, the objective of the game is to survive for 7 days on the island. Good luck on your survival journey!
**USER**: what are my stats
**ASSISTANT**: Great question! As mentioned earlier, your stats are randomly assigned at the beginning of the game.



In this hyper-realistic solo survival game on a deserted island, your stats will be assigned based on strength, intellect, agility, stamina, and focus. 



Your stats will range from low to average to above-average, with one stat being above-average, three stats being average, and two stats being low.



It's important to keep track of your stats throughout the game and adjust your actions accordingly to avoid exhaustion or injury. Good luck surviving on the island!
**USER**: Tell me my stats in list form
**ASSISTANT**: Certainly, here are your randomly assigned stats in list form:



- Strength: low

- Intellect: average

- Agility: above-average

- Stamina: low

- Focus: average



Remember to keep these stats in mind when making decisions and taking actions throughout the game. Good luck on your survival journey!
**USER**: I will meditate and improve my focus to above average
**ASSISTANT**: Great decision! By meditating, you can improve your focus and increase your chances of survival in the game.



Meditation is a useful technique that can help you relax and clear your mind. It can also improve your ability to concentrate and stay focused, which can be crucial in a survival situation.



To meditate, find a quiet spot on the island where you can sit comfortably. Close your eyes and take several deep breaths. Focus on your breathing and try to clear your mind of any distractions. Visualize yourself becoming more focused and alert.



After a few minutes of meditation, you should begin to feel more relaxed and centered. You can then continue with your survival tasks, such as finding food and water, building a shelter, and exploring the island.



As a result of your meditation practice, your focus stat will improve from average to above-average. Congratulations on taking a proactive approach to improving your stats and increasing your chances of survival!
**USER**: I have no chance at winning this competition of ideas lol. I need to refine this idea to 1 scenario.
