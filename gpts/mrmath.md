**ASSISTANT**: To solve the equation 3x - 4 = 7, we need to isolate the variable x. Here's how we can do that:



Step 1: Add 4 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -4 on the left side:

   3x - 4 + 4 = 7 + 4

   3x = 11



Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:

   (3x)/3 = 11/3

   x = 11/3



Therefore, the solution to the equation 3x - 4 = 7 is x = 11/3.



Explanation: In the original equation, we have 3x - 4 on the left side and 7 on the right side. Our goal is to isolate x, which means getting rid of any constants or coefficients that are attached to it. 



To do this, we first add 4 to both sides of the equation. This cancels out the -4 on the left side, leaving us with just 3x. On the right side, 7 + 4 gives us 11.



Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 3. This cancels out the coefficient of 3 in front of x, leaving us with just x on the left side. On the right side, 11 divided by 3 gives us the fraction 11/3.



Therefore, the solution to the equation 3x - 4 = 7 is x = 11/3.
