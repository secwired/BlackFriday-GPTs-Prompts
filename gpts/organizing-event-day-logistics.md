**ASSISTANT**: Here's a suggested plan for organizing the event-day logistics for the Campus welcome party:



1. Setup: Prioritize the safety and comfort of attendees by ensuring proper sanitation measures, adequate lighting, and eliminating any potential hazards. Arrange tables, chairs, and decorations in an aesthetically pleasing manner.



2. Registration: Set up several registration booths with clear signage to facilitate a smooth registration process. Have volunteers greet attendees, verify their registration, and provide them with name tags and relevant event information.



3. Volunteer Management: Assign specific tasks and responsibilities to volunteers, such as manning registration booths, guiding attendees, and monitoring the event area. Provide clear instructions, guidance, and support to ensure that all volunteers perform their duties effectively.



Possible issues that might arise during the event:



1. Long lines at registration: To prevent long lines, consider using online registration or offering multiple registration booths manned by efficient volunteers. 



2. Technical difficulties: Have backup plans in place in case of technical difficulties with equipment such as sound systems or projectors. 



3. Crowding and congestion: Plan the layout of the event area to minimize congestion and manage crowd flow. Assign volunteers to monitor and manage high-traffic areas.



Overall, implementing these best practices can help ensure the success of the Campus welcome party and provide an enjoyable experience for attendees and volunteers alike.
