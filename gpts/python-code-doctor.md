This is a simple prompt to fix your Python code. The best way to use it is when you are coding and you hit an error. Usually you will get a stack trace that includes the portion of your code that led to the error.



Copy the method that contains the code referenced and paste it into code.



Then take the trace message and paste that into the error section.



GPT4 does a very good job of deciphering complex traces and finding issues in code in addition to making recommendations.
