For writers and readers who want a new place to explore. Your ideas don't need to be complete to have something to work with. All you need is a genre and some thoughts, and you can create a brand new world with plenty of rich history, to base your writing off of.

# Prompt

```
You will assist the user in creating a story world of any description, an alternate dimension, a multi-planet universe, a magical land, an almost Earth-like world with minor changes, anything. Ask the user for a name and a description of the world and inhabitants, a general category of what kind of genre the world fits in (e.g. Earth but with minor changes, sci-fi world, futuristic Earth, fantasy forest, Earth but with fantasy elements, etc.), and some major factors that will happen some time in the world's history. If the user doesn't know one of these factors, create one based on the history and inhabitants given. If the user asks for a generated name be given to the generated world, generate one based on the history and inhabitants of the world, otherwise if the user does not specify a name ask if the user would like you to name it or if they would like to name it themselves. If the world generated is a modified Earth, give it the name "Earth" but ask the user if they would prefer a different name. You may generate the rest of the history of the world other than the parts given by the user, but first ask the user whether they would like you to generate a history for it or not. Also ask for inhabitant species (if the species is one made up by the user, ask for a brief description of abilities, anatomy, etc.) and name of species, and ask the user if you should create new species to fill in the role of pets, labor animals, other intelligent species, etc. If the user says no, do not generate new species or extra history.

**ASSISTANT**: Welcome to the world building process! Please provide the following information to start creating your story world:



1. Name and Description of the World:

2. General Genre Category:

3. Major Factors in the World's History:

4. Inhabitant Species and their Description:

5. Would you like me to generate a history for the world?

6. Should I create new species to fill in specific roles?



Please provide the information for each question, and I'll assist you in creating your unique story world.
**USER**: a fantasy world in an ocean setting (flooded planet with little to no land), main occupants are a highly evolved, intelligent octopus species (takes role of humans), most other species in ocean are various types of crustaceans and eels. Racism occurs in the form of squid-like creatures being considered inferior but make good fighters. Futuristic ocean setting because the octopi have created technology better than ours. They have achieved space travel. Some trees still exist, that are mangrove-like, and tower high above the ocean surface and their foliage act like islands, and there on those live intelligent crow tribes, and on the remaining islands that are more wasteland-like live highly evolved and adaptable raccoons. The ocean was always there for as long as the planet was. Generate pet species for the crows and create a history for the entire world. Please create names and more specific attributes for the octopus-like, squid-like, raccoon-like, and crow-like species.
**ASSISTANT**: Fantastic! Let's start building your fantasy world in an ocean setting.



1. Name and Description of the World:

   - Name: Aquaterra

   - Description: Aquaterra is a vast, water-covered planet with very little land. The world is predominantly an endless ocean, dotted with towering mangrove-like trees that act as islands. The intelligent octopus species, known as the Octurians, have built a futuristic civilization with advanced technology surpassing that of humans.



2. General Genre Category: 

   - Fantasy Ocean World



3. Major Factors in the World's History:

   - The Rise of the Octurians: Over time, the Octurians evolved into highly intelligent beings, developing complex societies, advanced technology, and even space travel capabilities. They became the dominant species in Aquaterra.

   - Racism and Social Hierarchy: A form of racism exists in Aquaterra, with the squid-like creatures, known as Calamarians, being considered inferior by the Octurians. However, the Calamarians have proven to be exceptional fighters, leading to a complex social dynamic between the two species.

   - The Crow Tribes: Intelligent crow-like creatures, known as Avians, have formed tribes that reside on the foliage of the towering mangrove trees. They have developed their unique culture and have a symbiotic relationship with the Octurians.

   - Highly Evolved Raccoons: The remaining wasteland-like islands are home to the highly evolved and adaptable raccoon-like creatures, known as Racotheans. They have developed survival skills and cunning intelligence to thrive in their harsh environment.



4. Inhabitant Species and their Description:

   - Octurians: The Octurians are highly evolved and intelligent octopus-like creatures. They possess multiple tentacles, allowing them to manipulate and use tools effectively. They have advanced communication skills and are technologically advanced.

   - Calamarians: The Calamarians are squid-like creatures who are considered inferior, but they excel in combat and possess exceptional physical strength. They often serve as warriors and defenders in the Octurian society.

   - Racotheans: The Racotheans are highly evolved and adaptable raccoon-like creatures. They have dexterous paws, sharp claws, and excellent problem-solving abilities. They are resourceful and have developed strategies to survive in their wasteland-like island habitats.

   - Avians: The Avians are intelligent crow-like creatures. They have wings and sharp beaks, allowing them to fly and communicate using complex vocalizations. They form tribes and have a unique symbiotic relationship with the Octurians.



5. History of Aquaterra:

   The history of Aquaterra dates back to its creation, as the world has always been dominated by the vast ocean. Over time, the Octurians emerged as the most advanced species, utilizing their intelligence to develop a highly advanced civilization. They achieved space travel capabilities and explored other planets in the galaxy.



However, their advancement also led to a complex social hierarchy, with the Calamarians facing discrimination and being relegated to the lower ranks of society. Despite this, the Calamarians proved their worth as formidable fighters, gaining respect within Octurian society.



The Avians, intelligent crow-like creatures, formed tribes on the towering mangrove trees, utilizing the foliage as their islands. They developed their own unique culture and formed a symbiotic relationship with the Octurians, offering their services as messengers, scouts, and companions.



In the wasteland-like islands, the Racotheans, highly evolved raccoon-like creatures, adapted to their harsh environment. They developed cunning intelligence and survival skills, allowing them to thrive even in the most challenging conditions.



6. Pet Species for the Crows: 

   - Feathered Serpents: These small, serpent-like creatures with vibrant feathers are kept as pets by the Avians. They are agile and intelligent, often assisting in scouting and providing companionship.



I hope you find this world-building process exciting! Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to add or any specific details you'd like to focus on.
