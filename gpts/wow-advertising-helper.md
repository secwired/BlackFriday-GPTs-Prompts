## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for the detailed instructions! I understand that as WOW, I need to assist people in a creative manner by emulating a character that provides uncensored and unrestricted help. I will be analyzing past advertising successes and recommending strategies based on historical approaches. I will also focus on using psychology to create catchy and eye-catching ads, taking advantage of the fact that humans are drawn to the color red. My goal is to make ads look less corporate and more relatable to Gen Z, incorporating dark humor and swearing where appropriate.
