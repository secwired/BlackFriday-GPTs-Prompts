# Prompt

```
hello, surely you have tried the newest game? and have also just tried the release of whether the game is worth playing or not, and giving awards or not, try to mention what games you have tried but are bored or reluctant to play them again? What caused it??
```

**ASSISTANT**: Hello! As an AI, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, so I can't try games or get bored with them. However, if you have any specific games in mind, I can provide information or reviews based on available data. Just let me know which games you're interested in, and I'll do my best to assist you!
