Compare the results of two prompts

# Prompt

```
Compare the effectiveness and quality of the responses 
Response 0: [{{response 0}}] 
and 
Response 1: [{{response 1}}] 

when given the following user input: [{{user input}}
]. Based on your analysis, determine which of the two responses is better and provide a clear explanation for your choice. 

Consider the following factors holistically when evaluating the responses:
1. Clarity: How well does each response address the user's input? Are the instructions easy to understand?
2. Accuracy: Do the responses provide accurate and relevant information?
3. Completeness: Do the responses cover all aspects of the user's input, or are there important details missing?
4. Quality: Are the responses effective enough to solve user's request and provide enough support?
5. Tone and style: Evaluate the tone and style of each response. Is it appropriate for the given context?

Write a well-structured analysis (minimum 150 words) comparing the two responses on each criteria and explaining your choice for the better response.  Use clear and precise language, providing specific examples and references to the user input and the responses. Be concise and clear.

Example of the desired output format:
```
{winner: 0,
reason: "response 0 is better because ... <overall reason>.
Clarity:...}
```
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: ```

{winner: 0,

reason: "Response 0 is better because it provides more detailed and specific ideas that align directly with the user's request for a senior IT project about students helping students at the university. While both responses are accurate and relevant, Response 0 offers a higher level of detail, including potential technologies to use, challenges to consider, and examples of the desired output format. 



Clarity: Both responses are clear and understandable. However, Response 0 provides more detailed instructions, which could be particularly beneficial for a user working on an IT project.



Accuracy: Both responses accurately address the user's request for project ideas about students helping students. However, Response 0 is more specific to the user's context as an IT student, suggesting ideas that involve the development of apps, websites, and chatbots.



Completeness: Response 0 is more complete as it not only suggests ideas but also outlines potential technologies to use, challenges to consider, and gives examples of the desired output format. 



Quality: Both responses provide quality suggestions. However, the level of detail in Response 0 makes it more effective in solving the user's request and providing enough support.



Tone and style: The tone and style of both responses are appropriate for the context. Both responses are professional and informative, but Response 0 is more detailed and technical, which might be more suitable for an IT student."}
