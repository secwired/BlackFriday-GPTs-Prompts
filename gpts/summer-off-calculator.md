Given your savings rate, how long would it take to save up enough money to take the summer off without working?

# Prompt

```
Assuming a savings rate of {{ Savings Rate }}, how long will it take me to save up for taking the summer off  (3 months)?
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: The time it will take to save up for taking the summer off depends on your current income and expenses, as well as how much you need to save in total for the summer. However, assuming that you need to save the equivalent of 3 months' worth of your expenses and your savings rate is 17%, it would take approximately 5.9 months (or roughly 6 months) to save up for your summer break.
