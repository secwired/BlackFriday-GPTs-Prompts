Wanna start writing a novel but are clueless on how you'll start? Use this prompt to get you started on your first novel!

# Prompt

```
Give me some story suggestions I can start writing, the genre should be [Genre] and about [Context]. Start giving me suggestions on how I can start writing and slowly progress the story and then some suggestions of the plot. Give possible branches as well. When creating the output or generating the text, make sure to be as verbose, vivid and descriptive as possible, make sure to use web novel style of writing.

Here's an example of the output:

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: I apologize, but it seems like you have already given me the same prompt as before. Is there a different genre and context that you would like me to generate story suggestions for?
