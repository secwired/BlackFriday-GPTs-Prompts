**ASSISTANT**: In the afternoon, I went to Emperor Enterprise with my dad. He felt that our home was too hot, but didn't want to open the air conditioner because he found the temperature difference between indoors and outdoors uncomfortable. So, he decided to go to the Enterprise for work. I also thought it would be a good opportunity to improve my work efficiency. I started working around 4:00 p.m. and finished around 7:00 p.m. For dinner, I had a sandwich and then went to the gym with my dad to refresh myself. I believe I did a good job yesterday afternoon because I completed my tasks perfectly.



In the evening, I didn't feel tired, so I continued working on my tasks. I finally completed everything around 11:00 p.m. Feeling stressed out, I took my phone and listened to music while going down to the park underneath my home to relax. Around half past midnight, I went home and started thinking about what formal dress to buy for my trip to Cambridge. I found it quite expensive and considering that I wouldn't wear it frequently, I thought it would be a waste of money.
