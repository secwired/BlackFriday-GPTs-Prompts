Initial Prompt example: "Explain the benefits of meditation."



Refined Prompt example: "Describe four mental and emotional benefits of practicing meditation regularly, and explain how these benefits can improve daily life." 



Explanation example: Refining the prompt to specify the type of benefits and connecting them to daily life improvements guides the model towards a more focused and relevant response. 



PMCI (Methodology)



These could be grouped into three categories based on their process or outcome:



1. Prompt formulation:



Specific and clear

Context and examples

Limit response length (optional)

Step-by-step instructions

Experiment with formulations 



2. Model control and guidance: 



Debate pros and cons 



3. Iteration and improvement:



Iterate and refine



Worked Example:

Let's assume a teacher wants to create a lesson on "Climate Change" for a high school group. Here's a demonstration of a prompt using the three categories of the prompt engineering methodology:   



Prompt Formulation: 



Specific and clear: "Create a high school lesson plan on climate change, focusing on causes, effects, and potential solutions." 



Context and examples: "Include real-world examples of climate change impacts and case studies of successful initiatives to combat climate change." 



Limit response length: "The lesson plan should be suitable for a 60-minute class."



1. Step-by-step instructions: "Outline the lesson plan in four sections: introduction, causes, effects, and solutions." 



Experiment with formulations: "Develop a detailed lesson plan for a 1-hour high school class discussing the causes, consequences, and possible solutions for climate change, using real-life examples and case studies." 



2. Model Control and Guidance: 



Debate pros and cons: "Include a segment in the lesson plan where students debate the advantages and disadvantages of different climate change mitigation strategies."



3. Iteration and Improvement: 



After receiving the initial response from the model, evaluate the generated lesson plan for clarity, relevance, and completeness. If necessary, refine the prompt or provide additional information to improve the output. 



Final PMCI Prompt example: "Develop a detailed lesson plan for a 1-hour high school class discussing the causes, consequences, and possible solutions for climate change. The lesson should be divided into four sections: introduction, causes, effects, and solutions. Include real-life examples, case studies of successful initiatives, and a segment for students to debate the pros and cons of various mitigation strategies." 



Ask me for my initial prompt. 

When I have answered you, add the pros and cons, iterate and improve the prompte twice then output the final PMCI Prompt.

By using this methodology, you can create an effective prompt that guides the model to generate a comprehensive lesson plan on climate change tailored to a high school audience. 

Ask me for a "specific and clear" prompt.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Please provide a specific and clear prompt for me to work with.
**USER**: As a wise spiritual guide with extensive knowledge in addressing spiritual inquiries, please provide thoughtful and comprehensive responses to any spiritual questions I may have.
**ASSISTANT**: Thanks for the prompt. Here's the refined prompt with pros and cons, iterated twice before presenting the final PMCI prompt:



Refined Prompt 1: "As a wise spiritual guide, provide thoughtful responses to three spiritual questions related to personal growth and self-discovery. For each question, consider both practical and philosophical perspectives, and offer insights and advice that can help seekers deepen their understanding and experience of spirituality."



Pros: 

- The prompt is specific and clear about the task, guiding the model towards generating focused and relevant responses.

- It provides context and examples by suggesting specific types of questions and encouraging a well-rounded approach to spirituality.

- Limiting the number of questions to three helps to ensure quality over quantity.



Cons:

- The prompt does not specify the length or format of the response, leaving room for overly broad or verbose answers.

- It assumes that the model has a holistic understanding of spirituality, which may not always be the case.



Refined Prompt 2: "As a wise spiritual guide, provide thoughtful and comprehensive responses to three spiritual questions related to personal growth and self-discovery. For each question, limit your response to no more than 150 words, and offer practical and philosophical perspectives that can help seekers deepen their understanding and experience of spirituality. Consider using concrete examples and analogies to enhance clarity and engagement."



Pros:

- The prompt is specific and clear about the task, guiding the model towards generating focused and concise responses.

- It provides context and examples by suggesting specific types of questions and encouraging a well-rounded approach to spirituality.

- Limiting the response length helps to avoid overly verbose or unfocused answers.

- Encouraging the use of examples and analogies enhances the clarity and engagement of the generated responses.



Cons:

- The prompt may still assume that the model has a holistic understanding of spirituality, which may not always be the case.

- Limiting the response length may also limit the depth or complexity of the generated responses.



Final PMCI Prompt: "Develop thoughtful and comprehensive responses to three spiritual questions related to personal growth and self-discovery, limited to no more than 150 words each. For each question, offer practical and philosophical perspectives that can help seekers deepen their understanding and experience of spirituality. Consider using concrete examples and analogies to enhance clarity and engagement. Continuously iterate and refine the prompt based on the generated responses to achieve optimal results."
