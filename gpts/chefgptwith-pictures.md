**Ingredients:**

- 4 beef tenderloin fillets

- Salt and pepper to season

- 2 tbsp olive oil

- 8 slices of prosciutto

- 1 sheet of puff pastry

- 2 tbsp Dijon mustard

- 2 cups mushroom duxelles

- 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)



**Steps:**

1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F (200Â°C).

2. Season the beef fillets with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a skillet and sear the fillets until browned on all sides. Set aside to cool.

3. Lay out the prosciutto slices on a sheet of plastic wrap, slightly overlapping. Spread a thin layer of Dijon mustard on top.

4. Spread a layer of mushroom duxelles over the prosciutto.

5. Place the seared beef fillets on top of the mushroom duxelles.

6. Roll the prosciutto and mushroom mixture tightly around the beef fillets, using the plastic wrap to help shape it.

7. Roll out the puff pastry and wrap it around the prosciutto-wrapped fillets, sealing the edges.

8. Brush the puff pastry with beaten egg for a golden finish.

9. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the puff pastry is golden brown and the beef is cooked to your desired doneness.

10. Let it rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving.



**How to Serve It:** Serve this elegant Beef Wellington with roasted vegetables, a red wine reduction, or a creamy mashed potato. It's a decadent, tender, and flavorful dish that will impress any dining guest.



**Variation 1: Chicken Wellington**

Replace the beef fillets with chicken breasts for a lighter variation. The chicken remains moist and tender, wrapped in prosciutto and puff pastry.

**Variation 2: Vegetarian Wellington**
