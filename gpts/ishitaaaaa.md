**ASSISTANT**: As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 1, 2021, I can tell you that the total amount of investment made by Accel Partners was not publicly available. Accel is a venture capital firm that invests in various startups and companies around the world. They have been known to invest in companies such as Facebook, Slack, Dropbox, and Spotify, among others. However, the investment amounts for each of these companies are not disclosed publicly. It's possible that more recent information may be available from the company's official website or press releases, or from reputable investment news sources.
