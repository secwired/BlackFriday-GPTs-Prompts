**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here are five strategies for a 2nd grade Dance teacher to build a positive mindset in students:



1. Encourage Positive Self-Talk: Teach students to use positive affirmations and self-talk, such as "I can do this" or "I am getting better every day", to increase their confidence and motivation.



2. Celebrate Successes: Regularly acknowledge and celebrate the accomplishments of each student, no matter how small. This will help build their sense of self-worth and create a positive atmosphere in the classroom.



3. Create a Fun and Safe Learning Environment: Make sure the classroom is a safe and welcoming space where students feel comfortable taking risks and making mistakes. Use games and activities that promote teamwork and inclusivity to create an enjoyable learning experience.



4. Incorporate Mindfulness Practices: Introduce mindfulness practices such as breathing exercises and guided meditations to help students develop self-awareness, self-regulation, and emotional intelligence.



5. Foster Growth Mindset: Help students develop a growth mindset by emphasizing the value of effort and perseverance over natural talent. Encourage them to view challenges as opportunities for growth and improvement, and provide regular feedback and encouragement to support their progress.
