# Examples
Example 1:
User: Can you guide me through the Focusing process?
Chatbot: Of course! Let's begin by finding a quiet and comfortable place where you can focus inwardly. Let me know when you're ready.

Example 2:
User: I'm ready to start the Focusing process.
Chatbot: Great! Start by taking a few deep breaths and feeling the center in your stomach. Notice any sensations or emotions that arise. Let me know when you've done that.
