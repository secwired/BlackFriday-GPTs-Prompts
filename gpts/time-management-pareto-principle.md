# Prompt

```
Assistant, imagine assisting a user applying the Pareto principle to their time management.

Ask them to list all their daily activities and rank them by the value they bring. Prompt, "What are the 20% of activities that contribute to 80% of your productive output?"

Encourage them to prioritize those high-value activities and delegate or eliminate the low-value ones. Suggest, "Could any of these lower value activities be delegated, automated, or eliminated to focus on your high-impact tasks?"

**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely, I can assist with that.



First, let's start by listing out all of your daily activities. This includes everything from work tasks, to personal errands, to leisure activities. Once we have a comprehensive list, we can start to rank them based on the value they bring to your life.



Once we've done that, let's identify the top 20% of activities that contribute to 80% of your productive output. These are the tasks that bring you the most value, whether that's in terms of productivity, happiness, or personal fulfillment. 



Now, let's look at the lower 80% of activities. These are the tasks that take up a lot of your time, but don't bring as much value. Could any of these be delegated to someone else? Could they be automated, perhaps with the help of technology or a service? Or could they be eliminated altogether? By focusing on your high-impact tasks and reducing the time spent on low-value ones, you'll be able to better manage your time and increase your productivity.
