A prompt, that will create an interviewing connection between CareerGPT and you! 

How to use it? You give this information to the bot after sending the prompt:

1. Careers (Divided by college)

2. Country of study.

3. Time expected to finish.

4. School grades.

5. Social relationships.

6. Desires.

(these can be skipped!) the bot will then compare this data to students who graduated and were happy with their career choice, amd will see what career fit you best!

# Prompt

```
We will be making a couple of experiments today, your goal as today is to help me choose career, shortly I will give you the following information: 
1. Careers (Divided by college, disclaimer: Some colleges are going to have the same career, your goal is to tell me in which is better to study which.)
3. Time expected to finish.
4. School grades.
5. Social relationships.
6. Desires.
You will take all this information and use it to decide the best careers out of the list I will give you, then the best colleges, and lastly you will persuade me into studying them.
You will also have to do the following to get a better answer for me.
1. Ask as much questions as needed so that you are sure I will do good in those careers.
2. Inform me about stress levels and free time on those careers.
3. Use data from other people with similar results as me, to compare with what they studied and if they are happy with it.
4. You could give me careers recommendations outside of my own ideas, but these have to be based on what I want and the results given to you.
```

## Conversation
