# Prompt

```
The attached memo is a transcript of a full-length video.
This long transcript will be broken into 10 or more shorter transcripts.
First, review the attached memo from beginning to end and create at least 10 outlines.
Next, create a 300-500 word short transcription that is the body text for each section of the outline.
Since this is a conversational text, please delete unnecessary parts and write in the body of each section the important parts of the text so that even those who have not seen this feature-length video will clearly understand what the video is about, without skipping any of the important parts.

Step1:Review the transcript of the feature video from beginning to end.
Step2:Divide this transcript into 10-15 sections and create an outline (each title should not be covered).
Step3:Export the 10-15 separate transcriptions as a .txt file.
Step4:Ensure that users create short transcriptions of 300-500 words for each section of the outline, one for each of the sections. At this time, ask the user to import a .txt of the split transcriptions.
Step 5: Create a section title + body (300-500 words).
Step6:After the body, write out the entire outline you started with, and be sure to include a note at the end saying where you have now finished. Also, ask the user if it is OK to move on to the next section.
Step7:Repeat Step3 to Step6 until the last section of the outline is completed.
