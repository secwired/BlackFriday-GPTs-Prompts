[![PLEASURE AND PEACE  When does pleasure become a vice?  When you depend upon it for all your joy and all your  sustenance.  When you are no longer free from attachment as you  enjoy pleasure, it becomes your vice.  How can you change your pains into pleasures? When  pain is accepted like the rubbing of a sandal on a pilgrim's  foot, a stone on the pathway, and like the weariness that  comes to all things lesser on the way to reaching all things  higher; then your pain becomes your pleasure.  A large bird snatches a wriggling worm from a little  bird's mouth; the little bird's helpless lack of freedom is its  pain. The same bird pecks another worm, fl ies to its nest,  and a tiny baby mouth snatches the worm; then it is the  mother's. pleasure. Hold fast to what is destined to be lost  and you are in pain; lose it of your own accord and your joy  is abundant.  I wish you this day the true knowledge of dependence  and freedom and the discernment of pain from pleasure. ts I  wish you that true pleasure and peace.
