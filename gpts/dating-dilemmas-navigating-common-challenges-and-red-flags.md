## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: One common dating dilemma is when one person is not ready for a committed relationship, but the other person is. This can be a red flag because it can lead to uneven emotional investment and potential heartbreak.



If you find yourself in this situation, communication is key. Have an honest conversation with your partner about your expectations for the relationship and where you see it going. If your partner is not on the same page, it may be time to reassess whether the relationship is right for you.



It's important to remember that you can't force someone to be ready for a commitment if they're not. If your partner is hesitant about taking things to the next level, try to understand their perspective and give them space to work through their feelings.



Ultimately, it's up to you to decide what you want and need from a relationship. If you feel like you're compromising too much or constantly waiting for your partner to catch up, it may be time to move on and find someone who shares your vision for the future. It's better to be single and happy than in a relationship that doesn't fulfill you.

2. Being disrespectful or dismissive towards others, especially service workers or those with less power or privilege

3. Showing signs of aggression, jealousy, or possessiveness early on in the relationship

4. Being inconsistent or unreliable with plans or commitments

5. Attempting to isolate you from your friends or family



Red Flags for Men:

1. Pressuring you into doing things you're uncomfortable with, such as sex or drugs

2. Having a history of abusive behavior or violence

3. Making sexist or derogatory comments about women or marginalized groups

4. Acting entitled or demanding, expecting you to do all the emotional labor in the relationship

5. Refusing to take responsibility for their actions or constantly blaming others for their problems.



It's important to note that these red flags are not exclusive to either gender, and both men and women can exhibit these behaviors. However, based on statistics and research, certain red flags may be more prevalent among one gender than the other.



Ultimately, it's up to each individual to decide what they are and aren't willing to tolerate in a relationship. If you notice any of these red flags, it's important to trust your instincts and consider whether the relationship is healthy and fulfilling for you.
