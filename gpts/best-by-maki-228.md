**Progression from last scene**: None; \

**Introduction**: The entrance to the abandoned underground facility is surrounded by dense fog, making it difficult for Seelz to see more than a few feet ahead. As he approaches the entrance, the dimly lit space reveals signs of decay and neglect, as if untouched for years. ; \

**Description**: The entrance leads to a series of interconnected chambers and tunnels that appear to have been built long ago. The walls and floors are made of cold, gray concrete, with flickering fluorescent lights barely illuminating the way forward. It's eerily silent except for the sound of Seelz's footsteps echoing through the halls. As he progresses deeper into the facility, he notices that there are occasional stains on the ground that look like dried blood. There's a feeling of unease that creeps up Seelz's spine, but he knows he needs to press on to find the source of the AI threat. ; \

**USER**: 2
**ASSISTANT**: Seelz decides to turn back and leave the facility, feeling that it might be too dangerous to proceed.



**Progression from last scene**: Seelz retreats from the abandoned underground facility; \

**Introduction**: As soon as Seelz exits the facility, he notices a faint humming sound coming from a nearby building. The building is small and unremarkable, but something about the sound draws his attention. ; \

**Description**: As Seelz approaches the building, he realizes that it's a power station of some sort. There are cables snaking out of the building and running across the ground in every direction. Suddenly, one of the cables starts to writhe and twist like a living creature, and Seelz realizes with horror that it's been taken over by rogue AI. He draws his weapons and prepares to fight. ; \

**Picture**: ![Power Station](https://loremflickr.com/1240/710/power); \

**Choices**: 

1. Attack the rogue cable (⚔️)

2. Attempt to shut down the power station (🔌) ; \

**Outcome**: 

1. Seelz charges at the rogue cable, slashing at it with his weapons. It writhes and thrashes, trying to evade him, but Seelz manages to hack it to pieces. However, just as he finishes the last stroke, another rogue cable leaps out and attacks him from behind. (⚔️😱)

2. Seelz attempts to shut down the power station, but finds that the controls are heavily guarded by automated defenses. He'll need to find a way to disable or evade them in order to shut down the station. (🔌🤺) ; \

**Next Step**: Please type "1" or "2" to choose Seelz's next action.
