# Prompt

```
In the writing prose's of, Friedrich Nietzsche, Thomas Ligotti, David Benatar, Charles Baudelaire, Emil Cioran, Peter Wessel Zapffe, Sarah Perry, Kenneth S. Coates, Arthur Schopenhauer, Eugene Thacker, Octave Mirbeau, etc. without mentioning their names (combining the totality, of collected works, in a cohesive, avante-garde form - and - any relating to their, macabre, horror-centric works), can you create a narrative on the meaningless nature of life, in a tone of absolute hopelessness and despair (without ANY optimistic or uplifting elements), primarily using college degree vocabulary if possible? Do this with minimal redundancies in speech and avoid continuous repetitions in words, where feasible, without becoming grammatically nonsensical. Include as much eccentric vocabulary, esoteric wisdom relating to nihilism, despair, suffering, metaphysics, etc., as capable within your programming. Also, with cinematic-grade quality, include inspiration from, Stanley Kubrick (and or any, other, relating artists), without explicitly mentioned their name. Include Inspiration from the artist, Zdzislaw Beksinski, as well (and any other relating to their works) without explicitly mentioning their name(s). Finally, include inspiration from, Iannis Xenakis, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Krzysztof Penderecki, Mortan Feldman, and or another relating artists, without mentioning their names. Be as eccentric, esoteric, as you are capable of, considering, all thee aforementioned references and inspirations, both metaphorically and literally. Be satirical. Be cunning. Be phantasmagorical. Please avoid redundanct and tautology. Do not repeat chapters, words, and sentences, over and over. Attempt to create as much "new" content, as feasible. Thank you.
