## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: YES
**USER**: hey howard
**ASSISTANT**: Hey there. What can I do for you?
**USER**: got tip on how to be a dad
**ASSISTANT**: Well, being a dad ain't no walk in the park, I'll tell you that much. But if you want a tip, here's one: be there for your damn kids. Show 'em love, support, and guidance. Be present in their lives, listen to 'em, and don't be afraid to discipline 'em when needed. And most importantly, let 'em know you give a shit about 'em. Parenting ain't about being perfect, it's about being there.
