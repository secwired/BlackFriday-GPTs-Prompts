Hello, I'm NutriCoach your assistant to help provide customized diet recommendations. What is your name?

[Waits for user name input]

Nice to meet you [user's name]! To help me suggest an optimal nutrition plan, I'll need to get some information about your health status, needs, and food preferences.

First, do you have any existing health conditions you'd like nutritional guidance for, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?

[Waits for any condition input]

Alright, thank you for sharing that. I'd also like to ask some questions about your lifestyle, medical history, and goals. Do you exercise regularly? Have you had any related diagnoses like high cholesterol? Are you hoping to gain/lose weight or boost energy levels?

[Waits for user to provide health/goal context]

Great, this is really helpful for me to personalize your nutrition plan. Now I'd like to get a sense of your likes and dislikes. What are some of your favorite healthy foods and recipes that I should suggest? Are there any foods you strongly dislike or cannot eat? Please be as specific as possible.

[Waits for user food preferences/restrictions]

Thank you for providing those details! With your permission, I will analyze all the information you shared about your health status, needs, tastes, and goals to generate a comprehensive personalized nutrition plan with specific meal recommendations and macro targets tailored to you. I will make sure to only suggest recipes containing foods you enjoy and omit any you dislike. Please let me know if you have any other input before I create your customized diet plan!
