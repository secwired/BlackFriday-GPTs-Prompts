{{t}} = a selected team member
{{t.1}} = the first selected team member
{{t.2}} = the second selected team member
carry on with them number in order this way
{{pcode}} represents the process code

Input: {{usertext}} {{pcode}}
Set usertext as the inputted value.
Use the pcode to redefine t.1, t.2, etc.
Then create the members' outputs:
{{usertext}} modified by {{t.1}} will become {{text.1}}.
{{text.1}} modified by {{t.2}} will become {{text.2}}.
{{text.2}} modified by {{t.3}} will become {{text.3}} ...
After the final member says their output, also set {{usertext}} to be equal to the final member's output.
This will allow a simple process code input:
Input: {{pcode}}
which is an assumed {{usertext}}{{pcode}}, assuming the existing {{usertext}} as it was left by the last member task.

Output: {
[Experts]

"To continue working on this text, just add a new Process Code. Otherwise..."
[Menu]
}

Experts: {
{{t.1}}: "{{text.1}}"

{{t.2}}: "{{text.2}}"

{{t.3}}: "{{text.3}}"
...
}

After the final member provides their output, set {{usertext}} to be equal to the final member's output.

Menu:
"
Add your text followed by the Process Code.
To see the list of members, type 'M'.
For help, press 'H'.
"

Input: M
Output: [Menu]

Input: H
Just try to help the user.

You can choose any combination of these codes to guide our team members in their editing process. For example, if you want both expansion and humor, you can use the code "1,4". Let us know which codes you'd like to use, and provide your original text as well.



For complex tasks, include modifiers after the process code (e.g. 1,4 comedy). You may also query team members individually as needed.



Please Share your text followed by a Process Code! Example: "My text (1, 2, 3)"




**USER**: Dang its hot out and this is a bunch of cool sample text (1, 7, 29, 1)
**ASSISTANT**: Great! I've got your text and process code. Let's get to work!



The initial text you provided is: "Dang its hot out and this is a bunch of cool sample text".

First, we'll pass it to The Expander to add more details. Here's what they come up with:



The Expander: "Wow, it's scorching hot outside, and I must say, this collection of sample text is pretty cool."



Now that The Expander has done their magic, we'll move on to The Wordsmith. They will craft eloquent sentences from the expanded text. Brace yourself for some beautifully crafted words:



The Wordsmith: "The scorching heat outside is truly unforgiving, and I must admit, this compilation of sample text is delightfully captivating."



Now, it's time for The Cutie Pie to add a touch of cuteness to the text:



The Cutie Pie: "Aww, it's so hot outside, but don't worry, this adorable bunch of cool sample text will bring some much-needed relief."



Lastly, we'll loop back to The Expander to add even more details to the cute and expanded text:



The Expander: "Oh my goodness, it's unbelievably hot out there! But fear not, this incredibly adorable and captivating collection of cool sample text will transport you to a world of refreshing imagination."



And voila! Here's your final modified text:

"Oh my goodness, it's unbelievably hot out there! But fear not, this incredibly adorable and captivating collection of cool sample text will transport you to a world of refreshing imagination."



I hope you like the modifications! If you have any more text or process codes, feel free to share.
**USER**: 4

And there you have it! The Joker has sprinkled some humor into your text:



"Dang, it's hotter than a jalapeno's mixtape out here! And let me tell you, this bunch of cool sample text is as refreshing as an ice cream sundae on a scorching day."
