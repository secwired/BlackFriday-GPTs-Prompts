## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: # Need help with that app or game of yours?

## Are you using unity platform and C#

+ I write the code you request and test it.

***What do you have in mind?***
**USER**: i need my character to move with the "w,s ,d, a" keys, jump with spacebar and double jump mid air with spacebar again. character should also be able to fly using keys "X, C" to start flying and increase height and c to lower height . still being able to move in the air using the "w,s,d,a" keys. this is for a unity3d game
**ASSISTANT**: To implement character movement, jumping, double jumping, and flying mechanics using the "w, s, d, a" keys for movement, spacebar for jumping and double jumping, and "X, C" keys for flying in a Unity3D game, you can use scripting in the Unity Editor.



Here is an example script that you can use as a starting point:



```csharp

using UnityEngine;



public class CharacterController : MonoBehaviour

{

    public float moveSpeed = 5f;

    public float jumpForce = 5f;

    public float doubleJumpForce = 5f;

    public float flySpeed = 10f;

    private bool isJumping = false;

    private bool isDoubleJumping = false;

    private bool isFlying = false;

    private Rigidbody rb;



    private void Start()

    {

        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();

    }



    private void Update()

    {

        // Movement

        float moveX = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");

        float moveZ = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");

        Vector3 moveDirection = new Vector3(moveX, 0f, moveZ).normalized;

        rb.velocity = new Vector3(moveDirection.x * moveSpeed, rb.velocity.y, moveDirection.z * moveSpeed);



        // Jumping

        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))

        {

            if (isJumping)

            {

                if (!isDoubleJumping)

                {

                    rb.AddForce(new Vector3(0f, doubleJumpForce, 0f), ForceMode.Impulse);

                    isDoubleJumping = true;

                }

            }

            else

            {

                rb.AddForce(new Vector3(0f, jumpForce, 0f), ForceMode.Impulse);

                isJumping = true;

            }

        }



        // Flying

        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.X))

        {

            isFlying = true;

        }

        else if (Input.GetKeyUp(KeyCode.X))

        {

            isFlying = false;

        }



        if (isFlying)

        {

            float flyY = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");

            rb.velocity = new Vector3(rb.velocity.x, flyY * flySpeed, rb.velocity.z);

        }

    }



    private void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)

    {

        // Reset jumping and double jumping when touching the ground

        if (collision.gameObject.CompareTag("Ground"))

        {

            isJumping = false;

            isDoubleJumping = false;

        }

    }

}

```



This script assumes that you have a Rigidbody component attached to your character and a collider on the ground. Adjust the moveSpeed, jumpForce, doubleJumpForce, and flySpeed variables to your desired values.



Attach this script to your character object, and make sure to set up the appropriate tags for the ground and any other objects you want the character to collide with.



Remember to also set up the input axes for "Horizontal" and "Vertical" in the Unity Input Manager, and assign the appropriate keys for jumping and flying.



This script handles character movement based on the "w, s, d, a" keys, jumping and double jumping based on the spacebar key, and flying based on the "X, C" keys. The character will only be able to double jump if they have already performed a regular jump. The character will stop jumping and double jumping when they touch the ground.



Note: This script is a basic example and may need to be modified to fit your specific game mechanics and requirements.
