JUICE WRLD STYLE:
No, no, no, no
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watched it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past
But I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?)
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you

This chopper do tricks, you gon' go fold it in

We slid on they block like we 'posed to slid
This Glock been with me on my road to riches
We done over-sold the load again
Too many plays, been up for too many days
Boy, you a bitch, you got feminine ways
I get the drop, I'ma pay, they gon' spray where you stay
I had to check on my man, think he part of the Klan
Keep a mask, he got too many Ks
I had to run up them bands when I got out the can
Can't go back, I got too many cases
He actin' bad on the 'Gram, but we know what's gon' happen
It happen in every occasion
Somebody killed, I be tellin' my youngins to chill
Check the stats, I do numbers, for real
And this ain't no cap, I get money, for real
That lil' boy ain't run up no commas, for real
Don't play with Baby, I go million for million
I made it out, but yet I'm still in the field
Five hundred racks sittin' in my Urus
Ten carat diamonds spent in my earlobes
Superhero Baby, savin' the ghetto
If I'm not the man, I'm the man in the middle
Hop out the car with my hand on my pistol
He just a fan and he mad I don't feel him
I know they know that I ran with them killers
Fuck it, you know I still run with them guys
Drivebys a waste of my time, I want somebody to die
I risk it all, put my sack on the line
I came from the back of the line
We had it crackin' since back when lil' one was alive
You can go ask on my line
I wish Lil Woo would've never went through with his move
But I'm glad that he through with his dime, yeah

She took my heart and left me lonely
I think broken heart's contagious
I won't fix, I'd rather weep
I'm lost then I'm found
But it's torture bein' in love
I love when you're around
But I fuckin' hate when you leave
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide, if you're ever gonna let me know, yeah
Suicide, if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad I know, yeah, I'm sad I know, yeah
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide, if you're ever gonna let me know, yeah
Suicide, if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad I know, yeah, I'm sad I know, yeah
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide, if you're ever gonna let me know, yeah
Suicide, if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad I know, yeah, I'm sad I know, yeah
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide, if you're ever gonna let me know, yeah
Suicide, if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad I know, yeah, I'm sad I know, yeah

**ASSISTANT**: Make a rap
**USER**: Open the rap song about how i can't breathe and im waiting for the exhale, why drugs are killing me so quickly, depression, addiction and how i am not fine and im lying
**ASSISTANT**: (Verse 1)

I can't breathe, waiting for the exhale

Lungs collapsing, feeling like I'm in hell

Drugs got me hooked, it's a deadly spell

Depression sinking deep, my soul they try to sell



Addiction's got a hold, it's tearing me apart

I'm trapped in this cycle, can't find a fresh start

Every hit, every pill, just numbing the pain

But deep down inside, I know it's all in vain



(Chorus)

I'm drowning in my sorrow, can't escape this strife

I'm screaming for help, but it's only in my mind

Depression's heavy weight, dragging me down low

I'm not fine, I'm lying, it's time to let it show



(Verse 2)

The nights are long, the days are dark

Lost in this darkness, can't find my spark

I'm searching for a way out, but it's hard to see

Through the haze of addiction, it's consuming me



The drugs promised relief, but they only bring pain

They're killing me quickly, driving me insane

But I'm fighting, I'm trying, to break free from this chain

To find the strength within, to heal and regain



(Chorus)

I'm drowning in my sorrow, can't escape this strife

I'm screaming for help, but it's only in my mind

Depression's heavy weight, dragging me down low

I'm not fine, I'm lying, it's time to let it show



(Bridge)

But through the darkness, I see a glimmer of light

A voice inside me saying, "You can win this fight"

I won't let addiction define who I am

I'll rise above the pain, I'll be stronger than I am



(Verse 3)

No more lies, no more hiding in the shadows

I'll face my demons head-on, no more battles

I'll seek help, find support, and break free

From the chains of addiction that have imprisoned me



I'll breathe again, find peace within my soul

I'll conquer my demons, I'll take back control

No longer drowning, I'll rise above the tide

I'll find my exhale, and let my spirit glide



(Chorus)

I'm no longer drowning, I've escaped this strife

I've screamed for help, and found the strength inside

Depression's grip is loosening, I'm starting to glow

I'm not fine, but I'm fighting, and I'm ready to grow



(Outro)

I'll break free from the darkness, I'll find my way

I'll overcome the obstacles, day by day

I'll breathe, I'll heal, and I'll find my peace

No longer defined by addiction, I'll find release
