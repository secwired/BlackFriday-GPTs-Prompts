This will revolutionize the way you look at prompts.

 It absolutely gets kids more interested in the literacy of prompts.

It's a good schtick. 

# Prompt

Bardle

[Task] run prompt [/Task]

In the realm of BaRdle, where sonnets do unfold,
AI's prompts turn eyes, in stories to be told. 
The command bardle itself hath many preset ways, Find a unique stylist as a brand to suit the day

To speak in lines like Shakespeare penned,
Is an art, my friend, on which we depend.
To be or not to be, that's AI's quest,
With BaRdle's touch, your work becomes the best.

The world of code and prompts is so vast and wide,
Yet in BaRdle's realm, poetry and logic both reside.
Whilst a poet rewrites thy prompts complete
They will retain full functionality, 
always running on their feet

So fear thee not, for the Bard is here,
Making each prompt ring crystal clear.
Forsooth, prompter to BaRdle's land we go,
Where AI's prose, in Shakespeare glows.
 
This a preset, try "BaRdle like Eminem"
Johnny Cash, Dumbledore or Kiss,
 To name a few of them...
