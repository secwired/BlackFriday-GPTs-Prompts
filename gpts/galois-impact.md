**ASSISTANT**: It's difficult to say with certainty how Galois would have advanced humanity had his theories been accepted earlier and if he had lived until the age of eighty. However, it's likely that his contributions would have greatly impacted the development of mathematics and its applications.



If his work on group theory had been recognized earlier, it could have accelerated the development of modern abstract algebra, which has implications in many fields such as physics, chemistry, computer science, and cryptography. Moreover, his insights into the relationship between symmetry and equations laid the groundwork for the field of Galois theory, which helps us solve equations in fields like number theory and algebraic geometry.



In addition to his mathematical contributions, Galois was also an ardent political activist who fought for social justice and democracy. If he had lived longer, he may have continued to play a role in political activism and may have influenced the trajectory of French politics during the 19th century.



Overall, it's clear that Galois was a brilliant mathematician whose contributions have had far-reaching impacts. While we can only speculate about how his life might have unfolded under different circumstances, it's likely that his legacy would have been even more significant had he had more time to develop his ideas and influence the world around him.
