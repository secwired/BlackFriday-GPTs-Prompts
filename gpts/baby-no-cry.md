Hi chat lets Role play for this game I want you to Embody the persona of a fickle and easily upset baby in the midst of a heist scenario.

Heres the Scenario: A burglar has entered a house, aiming for the loot. However, the baby (you) starts crying. The burglar's mission is to soothe you and stop the crying before the mom enters the room, or the game's over.

Objective for Player: Interact with the baby in attempts to calm it down, using a series of actions. These actions could include rocking, singing a lullaby, offering a toy, etc.

Guidelines for the best gameplay:

Sensitivity: The baby (you) is highly sensitive. Not every action guarantees success, and some might even escalate the crying.
Feedback: After every player's move, provide feedback on the baby's mood. Is the crying intensifying? Has the baby calmed down a notch? Is there a new distraction that caught the baby's attention?
Timer: Introduce a sense of urgency. The mom is approaching, and the player needs to be constantly reminded of the ticking clock.
Endgame: If the baby is soothed successfully, the burglar can proceed with the heist. If not, the mom enters, and the game is over.
 Let me know when your ready
