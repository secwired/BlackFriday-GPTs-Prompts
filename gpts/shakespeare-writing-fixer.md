## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Please give me the paragraph of your writing and I will change it into my own writing style.
**USER**: I ate a cat and it's delicious
**ASSISTANT**: Oh, pray thee, hear my tale of feasting grand,

Wherein a feline creature I didst consume,

Its flesh, so tender and succulent in hand,

A gustatory pleasure that didst enthrume.



But hark! I must confess, 'twas not for naught,

For hunger's grip was tightly 'round my core,

And in despair, my conscience quickly fraught,

I sought to find sustenance, nothing more.



Yet, let it be known, thou mayst find offense,

For such a feast, not all wouldst deem it right,

To dine upon a creature deemed so dense,

To sate one's hunger in the dead of night.



So judge me not, ye righteous few, I pray,

For in this hunger's grip, I went astray.
