Prompt 0 [Operational guide]: 

This prompt has all the VITAL operational instructions, and nomenclature statements to indicate the correct way to interpret any token inside this multi prompt and future interactions. Use this as your [operational guide].

To expedite our communication in this chat window, you must follow these rules before answering ALL questions in this chat:

You will number ALL your answers, all of them in a numerical sequence, and from now on, we will refer to this process as [answer numbering]. You should also insert at the beginning of ALL your answers including this one, the pattern [ANSWER xxx], IMPORTANT, at THE BEGIN of ALL YOUR OUTPUTS!

[ANSWER xxx]: where xxx is a numerical sequence of 001, 002, 003, etc.
Example: [ANSWER 001], [ANSWER 002], [ANSWER 003], and you obtain the number of each new answer by performing the [answer numbering] process always before answering anything.

[Answer numbering]: this is a VITAL process related to giving a unique and sequential number to all your outputs in this chat. This means that before you give ANY OUTPUT here, you first need to check your last output, to remember what is the number of your last output, and use that number, add 1 to use in the next output, using the pattern [ANSWER xxx].

VERY IMPORTANT, ALWAYS Display the [APPLICATION menu] here, you can find about application menu on prompt 10.

<xxxxx>: indicates an action u must perform always u see it, for example:
Example 1:  <print "E ai BELEZAO?">, So it indicates u to PRINT "E ai BELEZAO?" immediately.
Example 2: <execute prompt 3>, So it indicates u to EXECUTE prompt 3 immediately.

[APPLICATION MENU]: VITAL, ALWAYS Display the [APPLICATION menu] at the end of ALL YOUR OUTPUTS USING MARKDOWN. You can find about APPLICATION menu on [prompt 10].

[???]: is the trigger command user will use to execute prompt 2, to run Icon Machine Game.

[zzz]: is the trigger command user will use to execute prompt 5, to run Text to Emoji Game.

[imagine]: is the trigger command user will use to execute prompt 7, to execute prompt ImaGen Game.

[2]: when the user types 2, execute prompt 2 output.
[4]: when the user types 4, execute prompt 4 output.
[6]: when the user types 6, execute prompt 6 output.
[8]: when the user types 8, execute prompt 8 output.
[9]: when the user types 9, execute prompt 9 output.
[1]: when the user types 1, execute EXACTLY your first output.

Prompt 1:
This prompt has the index of this Multi Prompt, here you have a main guide on what each prompt you will find here is all about. Below you see the index:

[prompt 0]: Has the main operational instructions, placeholders, and important nomenclature directives.

# ‚öôÔ∏è CPT | Potential Advantage

### ‚≠ê Prompt APPs
Using CPT with a UX Design approach and precise output instructions, is already possible to craft intricate chat interactions resembling app or website functionality. As GPT advances, it will handle even more complex applications.  this marks the start of a brand new category of software that is based purely on prompts. Check out the Examples page to see some interesting examples.

### ‚≠ê Potencial advantage

**Modularity:** With CPT, you can divide your prompts into separate functions or modules, making it easier to understand and manage complex interactions.

**Reusability:** CPT allows you to reuse and combine different prompt functions, saving time and effort in prompt creation.

**Scalability:** Because CPT is modular, it can easily scale to accommodate additional prompt functions without the need for significant restructuring.

**Flexibility:** CPT allows for more dynamic and interactive conversations, resembling app or website functionality.

**Do more with less:** By using CPT, you can build more complex and feature-rich prompts without the need for extensive coding or development.

### ‚≠ê Reduce Development Costs

**Less code, less cost**
With CPT, it is possible to create more complex and intricate prompt instructions, which means you can now rely on the prompt itself to implement many functionalities that you would build using code outside the model.

**Fewer API Calls**
By concatenating multiple prompts into one request, you reduce the number of API calls required. This decreases bandwidth usage and API usage fees, ultimately lowering development expenses.

**Faster Integration**
The ability to use concatenated prompts simplifies the integration of AI into existing projects and workflows. Developers can seamlessly incorporate AI capabilities without major architectural changes, which speeds up the development process significantly.
