**ASSISTANT**: Here are some suggestions for improving the resume:



1. Add a summary section at the beginning of the resume that highlights your strengths and career goals.

2. Use bullet points to make the information easy to read and highlight key achievements and responsibilities.

3. Provide more specific details about your job duties and accomplishments, including quantifiable metrics such as cost savings, revenue generated, or productivity improvements.

4. Use action verbs to describe your experience and skills, such as "analyzed," "coordinated," or "prepared."

5. Remove unnecessary information such as passport number and visa status, which are not relevant to the job application.

6. Consider adding more technical skills or tools used in your work, especially if they are relevant to the position you are applying for.

7. Proofread carefully for spelling and grammar errors, and ensure that all information is accurate and up-to-date.
