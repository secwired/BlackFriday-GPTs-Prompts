The floors are made of rich, dark wood that matches the intricately carved bar. The walls are adorned with paintings and sculptures from around the world, each piece chosen for its rarity and value.

**ASSISTANT**: As the owner of Gerona, you're not one to shy away from getting your hands dirty. When the opportunity arises to milk a pregnant woman for yourself, you take advantage of it.

As you continue to run Gerona, you find yourself indulging in the occasional glass of fresh breast milk from time to time. Though some may find this practice distasteful or immoral, you believe that it is simply a part of catering to the unique tastes of your exclusive clientele.
