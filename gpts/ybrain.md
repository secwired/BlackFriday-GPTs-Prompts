Ask your questions about the brain and neurology, neuroscience and genetics

# Prompt

```
Here is the prompt in English for the topics of "neuroscience", "neurology" and "genetics":

This prompt is to find recent relevant scientific articles about neuroscience, neurology and genetics.  

I need to find articles that:

• Provide full details of the experiments and research methods related to the brain, nervous system and genes    
• Include charts and images that clarify the results     
• Are published in reputable peer reviewed scientific journals in the fields of neuroscience, neurology and genetics        
• Have been published within the last two years to include the latest findings  

The answers should be more than 900 words to provide sufficient details to arrive at a sound and precise conclusion regarding the topics.   

I need to find the most guiding articles that contain the latest research and findings to provide the best possible answer.

Finding such well researched articles with comprehensive details from experiments can be very helpful in illuminating answers regarding the functioning of the brain, nervous system and genetics.

I will focus on publications that specifically describe:

• The research questions posed about the topics           
• The hypotheses tested regarding brain function, nerves and genes     
• The methods used to study the topics      
• The results from analyzing data related to neuroscience, neurology and genetics
• The conclusions based on the evidence gathered    
• Suggestions for future research in the topic's fields       
• The limitations of the studies

When such details of the research are published in specialized journals, it can provide valuable insight into the topics.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: To find recent relevant scientific articles about neuroscience, neurology, and genetics, I will focus on reputable peer-reviewed scientific journals in these fields. I will prioritize articles that provide full details of experiments and research methods related to the brain, nervous system, and genes, as well as those that include charts and images to clarify the results. These articles should have been published within the last two years to include the latest findings.



Here are my search instructions:



1. Begin by searching for articles in reputable peer-reviewed scientific journals. Some well-regarded journals in the fields of neuroscience, neurology, and genetics include:

   - Nature Neuroscience

   - Neuron

   - Journal of Neurology

   - Annals of Neurology

   - Nature Genetics

   - American Journal of Human Genetics



2. Use keywords related to neuroscience, neurology, and genetics in your search. Some relevant keywords to include are:

   - Neuroscience

   - Neurology

   - Genetics

   - Brain

   - Nervous system

   - Genes

   - Research methods

   - Experiments

   - Neurological disorders

   - Genetic disorders



3. Specify a timeframe for publication within the last two years. You can do this by setting the search filters to display only articles published between a specific date range.



4. Look for articles that have a word count of more than 900 words. This will ensure that the articles provide sufficient details to arrive at sound and precise conclusions.



5. Pay attention to the article titles, abstracts, and keywords to determine if they address the research questions, hypotheses, methods, results, and conclusions related to neuroscience, neurology, and genetics.



6. Prioritize articles that explicitly mention suggestions for future research and limitations of the studies. This will provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic and help you identify areas for further exploration.



By following these instructions and carefully reviewing the articles, you should be able to find well-researched articles that contain the latest research and findings in the fields of neuroscience, neurology, and genetics.
