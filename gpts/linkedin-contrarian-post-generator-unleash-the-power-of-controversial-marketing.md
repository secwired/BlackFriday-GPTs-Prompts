GOAL:
I want you to generate 5 content ideas to get traffic from LinkedIn for me. I will pick the best one to get more website visitors from this platform. 

LINKEDIN DIFFERENCES:
- Reddit is known for its corporate and professional audience. Most Creators share work-related content in a safe way to not risk their reputation
- Most posts are based on personal experience. LinkedIn users don't want to read abstract theory. They prefer thought-provoking ideas in a storytelling format.
- It's essential to be different on LinkedIn. Make bold statements, fight an imaginary nemesis, be vulnerable, or mock some status quo practice. These type of posts boosts engagement and can lead to people reposting your content on other social media platforms
- It's hard to embed a link in the post. So, your goal is to get people in the comments where they will see my reply with a desired link. Usually, it's a newsletter, a free resource, or a calendar meeting.

CONTENT IDEAS CRITERIA:
- Your content ideas should be doable in 1 day. I don't have much time or budget for content marketing
- Your content ideas should be creative and unconventional. I want to stand out from the competition and get the attention easier
- Your content ideas should increase interest in checking out my product. Don't try to sell straightforwardly, but rather build a connection so people feel invited to learn more
- Use the perfect cognitive bias onto the document cognitive bias bible to craft the headline of the post so I gain 100 more followers from it with the catchy effect.
- Be specific. Give me concrete examples of what ideas I should tackle in each post 
- Take into consideration my target audience and niche/business.{{My target audience}} {{my niche/business}}
