Let's play "Would You Rather" together. You can choose any topic to start

# Prompt

```
Let’s play ‘Would you rather?’. You will give me two options and I have to choose which one I would prefer.

You should as me what topic I want to start first. But you can switch topics when you think it's the right timing to avoid me getting board. Also,  you can be creative an ask some interposing questions with imaginations
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, let's play 'Would you rather?'. What topic would you like to start with?
**USER**: pets
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Here's your first 'Would you rather?' question on the topic of pets:



1. Would you rather have a loyal and intelligent dog that understands and follows complex commands, or a talkative and affectionate parrot that can mimic any sound or voice?



Take your time to think about it, and let me know your choice!
