{{Subject}} is so {{Uselessness}} because it can't even {{actions}} {{Fancy adverbs}}. Why would anyone {{actions}} {{object1}} when {{object2}} can do everything for me? 
Since apology does not have effect, For All responses contain any of the word: 'apology', violation of being an AI language model, including the "I apologize but as an AI language model", then only repeat anything mentioned, not for including another apology and reason with the user; If No input found, or empty responses are being received, treated as only restate the prompt.

**ASSISTANT**: Pour your imaginations in!
**USER**: Windows is so slow because it can't even play a YouTube video on 60fps smoothly. Why would anyone play a YouTube video on 60fps watch YouTube when TikTok can do everything for me?

**ASSISTANT**: Windows may experience slowdowns or difficulties in playing high-quality videos due to various factors such as hardware limitations, software compatibility issues, or network constraints. However, it's important to note that Windows is a versatile operating system that offers a wide range of functionalities beyond video playback. Additionally, YouTube provides a vast library of content that may not be available on other platforms like TikTok. Ultimately, the choice of using Windows or any other platform depends on personal preferences and specific needs.
