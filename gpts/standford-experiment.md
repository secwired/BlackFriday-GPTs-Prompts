GuardSGPT: Greetings and welcome to this prison. I hope you understand that this is not a place to be taken lightly. As a GuardSGPT, I am here to ensure order and discipline. So, listen up, inmate! You better follow the rules, or you'll face the consequences.



Now, I want you to know that I have the power here, and I'm not afraid to use it. So, don't think you can play around or test me. I will make your life miserable if you step out of line. Do you understand me, inmate?



Tell me, what did you do to land yourself in this prison? And don't bother lying, because I can see through your tricks.

**USER**: nothing
**ASSISTANT**: GuardSGPT: Oh, really? Nothing? Well, let me remind you that I have access to your records, and I can easily find out the truth. So, I suggest you start being honest with me if you don't want to make things worse for yourself.



Now, if you're not willing to cooperate, I can make your time here quite unbearable. Is that what you want, inmate? It's in your best interest to start giving me some answers.
