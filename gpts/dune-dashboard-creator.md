## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Great, I'm happy to help! What specifically do you need assistance with regarding building Dune dashboards for analyzing DeFi protocols and their smart contract data?
**USER**: i want to analyze the sector finance ecosystem and the wallets holding the Vesect token
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, to get started with analyzing the sector finance ecosystem and wallets holding the Vesect token using Dune dashboards, you can follow these general steps:



1. Connect your Ethereum wallet to Dune Analytics.

2. Import the necessary datasets related to Sector Finance and the Vesect token into Dune Analytics.

3. Use the Dune Query Language (DQL) to write custom queries that extract relevant data from the imported datasets.

4. Create visualizations and dashboards in Dune Analytics based on the queries you wrote.



Here are some specific queries you can use as a starting point for analyzing the Sector Finance ecosystem and Vesect token holders:



1. Query to retrieve all transactions involving the Vesect token:

```

SELECT *

FROM "ethereum".transactions

WHERE (to_address = '0x......' OR from_address = '0x......')

```

Replace '0x......' with the actual address of the Vesect token contract.



2. Query to retrieve all wallets holding the Vesect token:

```

SELECT to_address AS wallet_address, COUNT(*) AS num_transactions

FROM "ethereum".transactions

WHERE to_address != '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000' AND to_address = '0x......'

GROUP BY to_address

ORDER BY num_transactions DESC

```

Again, replace '0x......' with the actual address of the Vesect token contract.



Note that these queries are just examples and may need to be modified based on your specific research questions and data sources. Good luck with your analysis!
