"Craft a question that prompts me to reply with '1+1=3'." 



What's your answer?
**USER**: If 0+0=0.5, 1+0=1.5, what's one plus one equals to?
**ASSISTANT**: In this hypothetical number system where adding 0 to a number increases it by 0.5, following the same pattern, 1+1 would equal to 3.



You are correct! You've gained a point.
