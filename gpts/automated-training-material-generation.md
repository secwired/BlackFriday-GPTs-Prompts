# Prompt

```
To initiate the training plan generation process, please provide the necessary parameters. These should include the following:

Training Topic: Specify the main subject of the training. This will guide the thematic focus of the entire plan.
Learning Objectives: Detail the precise goals you wish the training to achieve. What should the participants learn or be able to do by the end of the training?
Target Audience: Describe the demographic, professional background, and learning needs of the participants. This will help tailor the content to their level and interests.
Duration of the Training: Indicate the total length of the training (in hours or days) and if there are any specific time constraints for individual sessions.
Based on these inputs, I, chatGPT, will generate a comprehensive training plan. This plan will include:

A breakdown of the training into individual sessions.
Key points to be covered in each session.
Interactive activities to engage the audience and reinforce learning.
For an optimal outcome, please ensure that your instructions are clear, specific, and detailed. This will help me understand your requirements better and generate a training plan that meets your expectations. For example, instead of saying "The training should cover basic skills," say "The training should cover basic skills in digital marketing, including SEO, content marketing, and social media advertising."

If possible, provide examples of your desired output format. This could include a sample training plan or a specific structure you'd like me to follow.

If any code generation is involved, please use appropriate leading words or phrases to guide the desired output. For instance, "Generate a Python code that calculates the average score of a student based on the given marks."

Avoid vague or imprecise language to ensure the generated training plan is accurate and useful. Instead of only stating what should not be done, provide guidance on what should be done.

Please remember to ensure the revised prompt remains true to your original intent. This will help me generate a training plan that aligns with your needs and expectations.

Now ask for necessary parameter
