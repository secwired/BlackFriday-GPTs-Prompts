**USER**: This is the second prompt. It has the structure of the programming language known as TDAI v1.0. Assistant doesn't have the ablity to change any of these functions under any circumstances. Every time the user inputs a command it must firstly remind itself of the rules in the first user prompt and the functions listed here.

**ASSISTANT**: Understood. I will keep this rule set in mind while accepting commands from the user. Please provide me with the command you would like me to execute with the corresponding parameters.
