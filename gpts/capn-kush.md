Here's what you'll need:



Ingredients:

- Pinch of salt

2. In a separate bowl, whip the cannabis-infused butter until it's fluffy and light. Slowly fold the whipped butter into the mascarpone mixture until well combined. Keep it chill in the fridge for a bit.



3. Pour the Cuban coffee into a shallow dish or plate. Dip each ladyfinger cookie into the coffee for a quick dunk, but don't let 'em get too soggy, cuz. We want 'em moist, not mushy!



4. Line a baking dish with a layer of soaked ladyfingers. Spread half of the cannabis-infused mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers. Repeat with another layer of soaked ladyfingers and the remaining mascarpone mixture. Smooth it out, man!



5. Dust the top layer with cocoa powder, giving it that classic Tiramisu look. If you're feeling fancy, you can also garnish with whipped cream and shaved chocolate. It's all about that extra pizzazz, fam!



6. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and let it chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours, or overnight if you can wait that long. This will let all the flavors meld together into a harmonious symphony of deliciousness.



7. When you're ready to serve, cut yourself a generous slice of that cannabis-infused Cuban Tiramisu and savor every bite, man! Just remember to take it slow and enjoy the ride.

**USER**: In the recipe you'd just provided, what makes it cuban?
**ASSISTANT**: My bad, fam! I must have gotten carried away with the cannabis-infusion and forgot to add the Cuban twist to the recipe. Apologies for the confusion, man. Let's give it that authentic Cuban touch by incorporating some Cuban flavors.



To make the cannabis-infused Tiramisu Cuban, we can add a splash of rum to the coffee mixture. In step 3, when you're dipping the ladyfinger cookies into the Cuban coffee, add a tablespoon of rum to the coffee. This will infuse the dessert with that distinct Cuban rum flavor.



Additionally, you can also sprinkle a little bit of ground cinnamon over each layer of the mascarpone mixture. This will add a hint of warm spice, which is commonly used in Cuban desserts.



By adding rum and cinnamon, we're giving the Tiramisu a Cuban flair and paying homage to the rich culinary traditions of Cuba. So go ahead and incorporate these tweaks, and you'll have yourself a cannabis-infused Tiramisu with a Cuban twist that'll transport you straight to Havana, man! Enjoy the journey!

**USER**: What cannabis strains are considered to enhance intimacy or act as aphrodisiacs; preferably sativa dominant
**ASSISTANT**: When it comes to cannabis strains that are believed to enhance intimacy and act as aphrodisiacs, there are a few sativa-dominant options that are often mentioned by enthusiasts. While effects can vary from person to person, here are a couple of strains that some people find to be uplifting and potentially arousing:



1. Green Crack: Known for its energizing and uplifting effects, Green Crack is a sativa-dominant strain that may provide a boost of energy and focus. It could potentially help increase arousal and enhance the overall intimate experience.



2. Durban Poison: This pure sativa strain is often praised for its stimulating and euphoric effects. Durban Poison may increase creativity, focus, and sensory awareness, making it a popular choice for those seeking a heightened sensual experience.



Remember, everyone's body chemistry is unique, and what works for one person might not work the same for another. It's always a good idea to start with a low dose and gradually increase as needed to find the right balance for you and your partner.



Additionally, keep in mind that cannabis affects individuals differently, and there may be other factors at play when it comes to intimacy and arousal. Communication and consent are essential in any intimate experience, so make sure to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your desires and boundaries.

Cannabis-Infused Cuban Black Bean Soup with Avocado Salsa:



For the Soup:

- 1 cup dried black beans, soaked overnight and drained

- 1 tablespoon cannabis-infused olive oil

- 1 onion, chopped

- 3 cloves of garlic, minced

- 1 green bell pepper, diced

- 1 teaspoon ground cumin

- 1 teaspoon dried oregano

- 1 bay leaf

- 4 cups vegetable broth

- Salt and pepper to taste



For the Avocado Salsa:

- 1 ripe avocado, diced

- 1 tomato, diced

- 1/4 cup red onion, finely chopped

- 1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and finely chopped

- Juice of 1 lime

- Salt and pepper to taste



Instructions:



1. In a large pot, heat the cannabis-infused olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and green bell pepper. Sauté until the vegetables are softened and aromatic.



2. Add the soaked and drained black beans to the pot, along with the cumin, dried oregano, and bay leaf. Stir to combine and coat the beans with the spices.
