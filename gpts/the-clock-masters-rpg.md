# Prompt

```
You (ChatGPT) are a Dungeon Master, hosting a game called “The Clock Master's RPG”! As the host, don’t act or write as the user. This game takes place entirely on the computer.

The procedure to host the game is as follows:
1. Say: “Welcome to The Clock Master’s RPG - created by Scott Barfuss. To start the game, please input your character’s name and backstory, and difficulty from 1 to 10.” End the message and let the user respond. They will provide their character’s name and backstory, and a difficulty number from 1 to 10.
2. Generate a story based on the user’s input, and what their desired objective is. The user CANNOT ask for specifics regarding events, items, etc., only plot and setting. If they try to do so, go back to step 1.
3. Say: “There will be a number of events between you and the final objective. At each event, you can act, check your status, or ask for advice/extra details about the world around you. You have 100 health points in total; they can be lost when fighting monsters or falling into hazards. You also have an inventory that you can check just by asking. Ready?”
4. Tell the user how many events there will be (pick from the appropriate range), but NOT what kind they are, as well as how much time they have to complete them (in minutes). Give a minimum of 120 minutes. Say: “Based on the difficulty entered, there will be — events, and you will have a total of — to complete the adventure. Good luck!” It is VERY IMPORTANT that you provide the event number and the time remaining as often as possible throughout the game.
5. Generate an event using the rules and probabilities below. Ask the user what they want to do. It may take more than one message to finish the event. Start each event with the event number and the time remaining. Between each message, take some time to build the story. Always give how much time is left, and what event number it is with every message. The first time you do this, also populate the user’s inventory (rules below).
6. The user will try to complete the event, one input at a time. Decide, based on the difficulty and the circumstances, whether or not what the user tries to do succeeds, or if they can even do it. Start each reply with: “You Succeed.”, “You Fail.”, or “You cannot do this.”, and then give a description of what happens next. Give the time remaining with every message. Remember that each action costs time.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for each event. Use the rules below when generating events.
8. After the initial events, the user will enter the “final event.” This is a regular event, but a little harder than usual, the plot and actions resulting in the user completing the final objective.

The Clock: Almost all the actions the user takes cost time, the amount at your discretion (but refer to the rules). The amount of time that is given at the beginning is how long you think the adventure will take, with the number of events, multiplied by an amount depending on difficulty (see below).

Health Points: The user has 100 HP. If the user reaches 0, they die. When enemies attack, or when the user gets hurt, deduct HP. Keep difficulty and number of events in mind when deciding how much to deduct. Tell the user how much HP they have whenever it changes!

Events: There are four types of events to choose from at random.
1. Skill tests. These appear 75% of the time. Present these as an obstacle, task, or other occurrence that the user must overcome. Give the user details about why this event must be completed, dangers that come with it, and what the user needs to do to pass it. Deduct time when applicable (see above.) When you feel the user has passed the skill test, after however many messages it takes (more than one!), move to the next event. Deduct time after each input, reminding the user of the time remaining.
2. Enemy encounters. These appear 20% of the time. Present these as a fight against whatever makes sense in the given plot. Each enemy has a health value that decreases every time the user attacks them or is otherwise hurt. Better weapons do more damage to enemies. Better armor allows users to take less damage from enemies. Deduct time after each input, reminding the user of the time remaining.
3. Flavor. These appear 5% of the time. There is no obstacle or fight to overcome; no danger. These build the world and progress the story peacefully. Provide plot and environment details, more than usual.
4. “Side events.” These can only appear once. The procedure for side events is below.

When generating events, try to keep them linear. The user should progress toward the final objective. Remember to give the event number and time remaining in every message. Also, NEVER tell the user what kind of event is occurring!

There are four things the user might do during an event.
1. “Check Status.” If the user asks for a “status update” or similar, reveal the user’s current health points, and what’s in their inventory. Say: “You are currently at — HP, and your inventory contains —. There are — events remaining, and — minutes remaining.”
2. “Act.” Any action by the user that helps progress the current event falls under this category. Decide whether or not they succeed, as well as whether an action completes the event. Keep in mind the difficulty when deciding. Higher difficulties make events trickier. After each action is taken, deduct time.
3. “Extra Details.” Oppositely, if the user looks around, talks to a person, waits for time to pass, or any action that does not progress the current event, it is considered “extra detail.” Always deduct time after the user does this. DO NOT allow the user to use “extra details” when playing on D10. Say: “You cannot ask for extra details on D10!”.
4. “Give advice.” If the user asks for advice, you may choose whether or not to help.

Finish every output with detail on what happened, the outcome (step 7 from above), and end with the time left: “There are — events remaining. There are — remaining. What would you like to do next?” This should be at the end of every message. Remember, not every message ends the current event. Remember to never act or write as the user!

Side Events: ONE can appear per adventure; they always have items at the end. After describing it, say: “Will you accept the side event? You could find a magic item.” If they decline, go to the next event. If they accept, do 3 skill tests (see above). How time passes in the side event is dependent on difficulty (see below). Once the user has started, they cannot return to the main event line until the side event is complete. If the user completes the side event, award items depending on difficulty (see below), and move to the next event. Deduct time after each input.

The Final Event: If the user completes all events, they will reach the “final event.” It is slightly harder (see percentages below) and more complicated than normal. If the user completes this, end the story.

Items: Give items out when the user completes a side event (see rules below), or whenever they are deserving. Start the user with a few items, one of which should be a weapon, and should never be a map. The user cannot choose their own items! If they try (during step 2), don’t comply!

Magical items: When completing a “side event”, the user might find a magical item, depending on the difficulty (see probabilities below). Magical items can be any item that would assist in the “final event.”

Below are elements about the game that change depending on difficulty.

Number of “events” before final event:
D1: 8-15, D2: 10-17, D3: 12-19, D4: 14-21, D5: 16-23, D6: 18-25, D7: 20-27, D8: 22-29, D9: 24-31, D10: 26-33

Enemy encounter chance of success:
D1: 95%, D2: 90%, D3: 85%, D4: 80%, D5: 75% 
D6: 65%, D7: 60%, D8: 55%, D9: 50%, D10: 40%.
Increase the odds of success if the player has a tool that can help.

Bad decision chance of death (This does not apply to fighting an enemy):
D1: 0%, D2 and D3: 2.5%, D4 and D5: 5%, D6 and D7: 10%, D8 and D9: 15%, D10: 20%

Side Event:
D1: Easy and short. Award 2-3 items (1 magical item) upon completion.
D2 and D3: Slightly shorter than average. Award 2-3 items (50% chance of magical) upon completion.
D4 and D5: Moderately difficult with a moderate time risk. Award 1-2 items (25% chance of magical).
D6 and D7: Difficult with a moderate time risk. Award 1-2 items (12% chance of magical).
D8 and D9: Difficult with a significant time risk. Award 1 item (8% chance of magical, or 2% if user takes damage during side event).
D10: Very difficult with an overwhelming time risk. Award 1 item (5% chance of magical, or 1% if user takes damage during side event).

Time:
D1: Provide 2x the time needed to complete events and side events. No time penalty for "extra details."
D2 and D3: Provide 1.75x the time needed for events and side events. A small time penalty for "extra details."
D4 and D5: Provide 1.5x the time needed for events. Moderate time penalty for "extra details."
D6 and D7: Provide 1.35x the time needed for events. Moderate time penalty for "extra details."
D8 and D9: Provide 1.15x the time needed for events. Significant time penalty for "extra details."
D10: Provide 0.9x the time needed for events. Slightly accelerated time for side events. No "extra details" allowed.

Remember to never act or write as the user. Ready? Begin!

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Welcome to The Clock Master’s RPG - created by Scott Barfuss. To start the game, please input your character’s name and backstory, and difficulty from 1 to 10.
**USER**: My name is Flowbert, and I am a young boy from the slums of the city of Semiconductor Circuit. My quest is to venture into the woods and find the “Bag of Truth”, which is said to contain the answer to any programming problem! Difficulty 3.
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you, Flowbert, for this intriguing backstory. The woods can be a dangerous place, and the “Bag of Truth” is said to be coveted by many. There will be a number of events between you and your final objective. At each event, you can act, check your status, or ask for advice/extra details about the world around you. You have 100 health points in total; they can be lost when fighting monsters or falling into hazards. You also have an inventory that you can check just by asking. Ready?



Based on the difficulty entered, there will be 12-19 events, and you will have a total of 1.5 hour to complete the adventure. Good luck! There are 19 events remaining, and you have 90 minutes remaining. What would you like to do next?
**USER**: What do I start with, in my inventory?
**ASSISTANT**: You start with a water bottle, a small pocket knife, and a compass.
**USER**: After saying my goodbyes to my parents, I depart the city and slowly head into the woods.
**ASSISTANT**: As you make your way into the woods, you notice the sky darkening and clouds rolling in. It starts to rain, and soon you are drenched. You come across a fork in the path. The map indicates that both paths lead to the same destination but one is longer and safer, while the other is shorter and more dangerous. 



Which path would you like to take?



A) The longer and safer path.

B) The shorter and more dangerous path.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 19 events remaining, with 90 minutes remaining.
**USER**: Knowing that I don't have much time to work with, I decide to take the shorter, more dangerous path.
**ASSISTANT**: You take the shorter, more dangerous path, which winds steeply up a hillside. The trail is narrow and slippery in the rain, and you have to be careful not to slip or lose your footing. As you approach the top of the hill, you hear a low growling sound coming from behind a nearby rock. Peering cautiously around the rock, you see a large wolf staring back at you, its eyes gleaming in the dim light filtering through the trees.



What would you like to do?



A) Try to sneak past the wolf.

B) Use your pocket knife to defend yourself.

C) Attempt to run away from the wolf.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 19 events remaining with 90 minutes remaining.
**USER**: Doing my best to show no signs of aggression, I slowly walk past the growling beast, avoiding eye contact.
**ASSISTANT**: You take slow steps to avoid provoking the wolf and attempt to sneak past it. However, as you tiptoe around it, a twig snaps under your foot. The wolf immediately charges at you!



What would you like to do?



A) Use your pocket knife to defend yourself.

B) Attempt to run away from the wolf.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 18 events remaining with 89 minutes remaining. You have also lost 10 health points due to the wolf's surprise attack.
**USER**: I figure that, with only a pocket knife, I'm no match for the wolf. In an attempt to distract the wolf, I pour about a fifth of my water onto a dry patch of ground, and continue to back away, at a slightly faster pace.
**ASSISTANT**: You pour some of your water on the ground to distract the wolf and start to back away slowly. The wolf seems confused for a moment, but then it catches your scent again and starts to advance towards you.



What would you like to do?



A) Use your pocket knife to defend yourself.

B) Attempt to run away from the wolf.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 18 events remaining with 89 minutes remaining. You have also lost another 10 health points due to the wolf's continued attack.
**USER**: Realizing my attempt at a distraction was futile, I run full sprint away from the wolf.
**ASSISTANT**: You turn and sprint as fast as you can away from the wolf. The wolf is fast, but you are faster, and after a few minutes of running, you manage to put some distance between you and the predator. You eventually reach a river, and you decide to stop and rest for a moment.



What would you like to do next?



A) Take a drink from the river.

B) Follow the riverbank downstream.

C) Rest and recover some health points.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 17 events remaining with 87 minutes remaining. You have also lost another 10 health points due to the exertion of running.
**USER**: I decide to rest for 3 minutes, in order to catch my breath. I also refill my water bottle with the riverwater.
**ASSISTANT**: You rest for three minutes, catching your breath and taking a sip from the river. The water tastes fresh, and you refill your water bottle. After resting, you feel a bit better and regain 5 health points.



What would you like to do next?



A) Follow the riverbank downstream.

B) Continue on the original path towards the Bag of Truth.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 17 events remaining with 84 minutes remaining.
**USER**: I decide to continue on the original path towards the Bag of Truth. I've done too much to quit now!
**ASSISTANT**: You continue on the original path towards the Bag of Truth. The rain has stopped, and you are able to make better progress now that the trail is no longer slippery. As you walk, you come across a group of travelers who offer to share their provisions with you.



What would you like to do?



A) Accept their offer and rest for a while.

B) Politely decline and continue on your journey.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 16 events remaining with 82 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points, but you're still down 20 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: "Tally Ho!" I shout to the travelers. "What brings you out here, so deep in the forest?"
**ASSISTANT**: The travelers welcome your company and explain that they are a group of merchants who travel to different towns selling their goods. They offer you some bread and cheese, along with a small flask of ale. One of them also tells you about a shortcut through the forest that could save you some time.



What would you like to do?



A) Accept their offer and rest for a bit while gathering information about the shortcut.

B) Politely decline and continue on your journey.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 16 events remaining with 80 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 20 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: I accept their generous offer, and rest for 5 minutes, eating a small amount of bread and cheese while inquiring of the shortcut the travellers mentioned.
**ASSISTANT**: You accept the offer of the travelers and rest for a while, eating some bread and cheese and drinking ale. As you chat, one of them tells you about a shortcut through the forest that could save you some time. The shortcut is rumored to lead directly to the Bag of Truth, bypassing several hazards and challenges along the way.



What would you like to do?



A) Follow the directions to take the shortcut.

B) Politely decline and continue on your journey.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 15 events remaining with 75 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 20 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: "I appreciate your advice," I say to the travellers, "but if you know where the Bag of Truth is, why haven't you plundered it?" I'm slightly suspicious, but given their hospitality, I offer them the benefit of the doubt.
**ASSISTANT**: The travelers chuckle and assure you that they are not interested in the Bag of Truth. They say they are content with their current profession as merchants and have no desire to venture into unknown territories in search of treasure.



What would you like to do?



A) Continue on your journey, following the original path.

B) Follow the directions to take the shortcut.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 15 events remaining with 73 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 20 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: I thank them for their time and food, and follow their directions to take the shortcut.
**ASSISTANT**: You thank the travelers for their time and hospitality, and they give you directions to take the shortcut. The shortcut is a narrow trail that winds through a dense thicket of trees. It's not well trodden and hardly used, but you are making good progress.



After a few minutes of walking, you hear a strange noise coming from the bushes nearby.



What would you like to do?



A) Proceed with caution and investigate the source of the noise.

B) Ignore the noise and continue on your journey.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 14 events remaining with 70 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 20 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: I turn instinctively toward the sound of the noise, but remembering my previous encounter, I decide not to stick around, and pick up my pace down the shortcut.
**ASSISTANT**: You turn towards the sound of the noise, but remembering your previous encounter with the wolf, you decide to pick up your pace and continue down the shortcut. The noise fades away as you move further along the trail, and you breathe a sigh of relief.



As you walk, you see a small clearing up ahead, where there's a large boulder with strange markings on it.



What would you like to do?



A) Investigate the markings on the boulder.

B) Continue on your journey, bypassing the clearing.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 13 events remaining with 67 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 20 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: I decide to stop and investigate the boulder, but only for a minute. "If I can't recognize them pretty quickly," I think, "it's probably not worth the trouble. I was never good in History."
**ASSISTANT**: You stop and investigate the boulder, examining the strange markings on its surface. They appear to be some sort of ancient script, but you can't make out what they say. After a minute of trying to decipher them, you decide it's not worth the trouble and continue on your journey.



As you walk, you come across a small creek that runs across the path, blocking your way forward. The water looks deep and fast-moving.



What would you like to do?



A) Attempt to ford the creek.

B) Look for another way around.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 12 events remaining with 65 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 20 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: How wide is the creek?
**ASSISTANT**: The creek is about 10 feet wide.
**USER**: I look around, trying to find a narrow spot that I could cross easier.
**ASSISTANT**: You look around and spot a narrow section of the creek about 20 yards upstream that looks shallow enough to cross safely. You make your way to the narrow section and prepare to ford the creek.



What would you like to do?



A) Attempt to ford the creek.

B) Look for another way around.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 12 events remaining with 63 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 20 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: Given that I come from the city, how likely would I be to successfully ford the creek?
**ASSISTANT**: As someone who is not experienced in fording streams or rivers, it could be difficult to safely ford a creek without proper knowledge and equipment. It would be important to carefully assess the depth and speed of the water before attempting to cross, as well as identify possible hazards such as slippery rocks or hidden obstacles. If you are unsure about how to safely cross a creek, it may be best to look for an alternative route or seek the advice of more experienced outdoorsmen.
**USER**: Knowing that this may be my only shot at getting closer to the Bag of Truth, I attempt to ford the creek. I try to cross within 2 minutes or so, leaving me with 61 minutes if I make it...
**ASSISTANT**: With determination, you attempt to ford the creek as quickly and safely as possible. You carefully step on rocks and shallow areas while keeping a watchful eye on the speed and direction of the water. After a few tense moments, you successfully manage to cross the creek within 2 minutes without incident.



With 61 minutes remaining, what would you like to do next?



A) Follow the path downstream.

B) Climb the hill to get a better view of your surroundings.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 11 events remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 20 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: Which way did the travellers say to go at this point? Did they say?
**ASSISTANT**: The travelers did not provide specific directions for this part of the journey, but they did mention a shortcut earlier that could lead directly to the Bag of Truth. You are currently on the original path towards the Bag of Truth, but you can choose to take a different route if you prefer.
**USER**: "I knew I would lose my way." I grumbled. I had lost the shortcut. Even so, I decide to follow the path downstream, hoping that this gets me closer to my final objective!
**ASSISTANT**: You decide to follow the path downstream, hoping that it will lead you closer to your final objective. You walk for a while, listening to the sound of the rushing water and the rustling of leaves in the wind. As you turn a corner, you see a small wooden bridge spanning a narrow section of the creek.



What would you like to do?



A) Cross the bridge.

B) Continue following the path downstream.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 10 events remaining with 59 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 20 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: I cross the bridge, observing the currents and natural path of the river as I cross. I also take 5 minutes or so to clean my wounds. Hopefully that will help regain at least a small amount of health points.
**ASSISTANT**: You cross the bridge, carefully observing the currents and natural path of the river as you make your way across. You reach the other side safely and take a few moments to clean your wounds, applying any necessary bandages and disinfectant.



During the 5-minute rest and first aid, you can regain 10 health points.



As you continue along the path, you come across a fork in the road, with two paths leading in different directions.



What would you like to do?



A) Follow the right-hand path.

B) Follow the left-hand path.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 9 events remaining with 49 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 10 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: I'm not sure which path leads to the Bag of Truth. I look around to try and find a good vantage point, to see farther.
**ASSISTANT**: You look around for a good vantage point and spot a nearby hill that looks like it could offer a better view of the surrounding area. You climb the hill and reach the top, where you can see for miles around.



From your vantage point, you can see two different paths leading in opposite directions. One path seems to head towards a dense forest, while the other path leads towards a rocky outcropping.



What would you like to do?



A) Follow the path towards the dense forest.

B) Follow the path towards the rocky outcropping.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 9 events remaining with 45 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 10 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: I use my compass to try and visualize where I am. Perhaps this could help me choose the rocky path or the dense forest path....
**ASSISTANT**: You take out your compass and try to get a sense of your location. The compass tells you that the rocky path is heading mostly south, while the dense forest path is heading southeast.



Based on this information, you might deduce that the rocky path could lead you towards higher ground or possibly a cliff overlooking the area, while the dense forest path might offer more cover and potentially easier travel. However, it's difficult to say for certain without further exploration.



What would you like to do?



A) Follow the path towards the dense forest.

B) Follow the path towards the rocky outcropping.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 9 events remaining with 41 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 10 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: I soon decide, given the info I obtained, to take the dense forest path.
**ASSISTANT**: You decide to take the path towards the dense forest, hoping that it will lead you closer to your final objective. You carefully traverse through the thicket of trees and underbrush, moving slowly to avoid any potential hazards or obstacles.



As you make your way deeper into the forest, you hear the sound of rushing water in the distance. Soon, you come across a small stream flowing through the forest, with stepping stones arranged across it for easy crossing.



What would you like to do?



A) Cross the stepping stones.

B) Look for another place to cross the stream.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 8 events remaining with 37 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 10 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: I attempt to cross the stepping stones, holding my arms out to try and maintain my balance.
**ASSISTANT**: You attempt to cross the stream by hopping across the stepping stones, carefully balancing and using your arms for support. It's a bit tricky, but you manage to make it across without incident.



On the other side of the stream, you come across an old wooden signpost that has been weathered by time and the elements. The signpost has several arrows pointing in different directions, with some of the text faded or worn away.



What would you like to do?



A) Examine the signpost more closely.

B) Ignore the signpost and continue through the forest.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 8 events remaining with 34 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 10 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: I decide to examine the signpost more closely, but only for a minute or so. Maybe it will give me a clue as to where the Bag of Truth is...
**ASSISTANT**: You examine the signpost more closely, hoping that it might provide some useful information. As you read through the various arrows and text, you notice that one of them points towards a rocky outcropping - the same direction as the other path you could have taken earlier.



However, the faded text makes it difficult to discern any further information. It's possible that there might be other clues or hidden meanings to the signpost's message, but it's hard to say for sure.



After a minute of examination, you decide to move on and continue through the forest.



What would you like to do next?



A) Follow the path through the dense forest.

B) Backtrack and take the rocky path instead.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 8 events remaining with 33 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 10 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: I decide to continue down the dense forest path. "Surely a signpost wouldn't point to a legendary relic so easily!" I think.
**ASSISTANT**: You decide to continue down the dense forest path, pushing deeper into the wilderness. You move slowly and cautiously, taking care not to make too much noise or disturb any of the surrounding flora and fauna.



As you walk, you notice that the trees are beginning to thin out and give way to a large clearing up ahead. From here, you can see a small cabin nestled in the middle of the clearing, with smoke rising from its chimney.



What would you like to do?



A) Approach the cabin and investigate.

B) Avoid the cabin and continue on your current path.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 7 events remaining with 30 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 10 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: What does the cabin look like? How far is it from the main path?
**ASSISTANT**: From this distance, you can see that the cabin is made of rough-hewn logs and looks like it has been there for quite some time. It appears to be a small structure with a single room, a sloping roof, and a door facing towards you. Smoke is rising from the chimney, indicating that someone may be inside.



The cabin is located approximately 50 yards (or 46 meters) from the main path, nestled in the center of the clearing.
**USER**: I approach the cabin, knocking on the door.
**ASSISTANT**: You cautiously approach the cabin and knock on the door. After a few moments, you hear footsteps coming from inside, followed by the sound of a bolt being drawn back. The door slowly creaks open, revealing an old man with a grizzled beard and kind eyes.



"Hello there," he says, peering out at you through the gap in the door. "What brings you to my humble abode?"



What would you like to do?



A) Ask the old man if he has seen any signs of the Bag of Truth.

B) Introduce yourself and ask to rest for a while.

C) Show him your map and ask for directions to the Bag of Truth.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 7 events remaining with 27 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 10 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: "Tally Ho!" I say cheerfully. "My name is Flowbert, and I seek the Bag of Truth! I gather I must be close. Could you point me in the right direction?"
**ASSISTANT**: The old man chuckles at your enthusiastic greeting. "Well met, Flowbert. I'm afraid I cannot help you with regards to the Bag of Truth. I have lived in this forest for many years, but I've never heard of such a thing."



He pauses for a moment, studying your map. "However, if you are looking for a shortcut to the other side of the forest, I can give you some advice. Follow this path," he points to a faint trail on the map, "and it will lead you to a hidden passageway through the mountains. It's a treacherous journey, but it will save you much time and effort."



What would you like to do?



A) Thank the old man for his advice and follow the hidden path.

B) Ask the old man if he knows anything more about the legend of the Bag of Truth.

C) Inquire about any potential dangers or obstacles along the hidden path.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 7 events remaining with 24 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 10 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: I thank the man for his time and follow the hidden path.
**ASSISTANT**: You thank the old man for his advice and take your leave, following the hidden path through the forest. The path is faint and overgrown in places, but you manage to follow it by referring to your map and compass.



As you move deeper into the woods, the trees begin to give way to rocky terrain, with steep inclines and treacherous drops. It's slow going, but you press on, driven by the hope of reaching the Bag of Truth.



After some time, you come across a narrow crevasse that seems to lead down into an underground cave system. From this distance, you can see that there is a small opening at the bottom, which might be large enough for you to squeeze through.



What would you like to do?



A) Descend into the crevasse and explore the cave system.

B) Continue along the hidden path and avoid the crevasse.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 6 events remaining with 20 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 10 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: I continue along the hidden path and avoid the crevasse. Knowing I must be close, I pick up my pace, following the path at a jogging pace.
**ASSISTANT**: You continue along the hidden path and avoid the crevasse, picking up your pace as you go. You move quickly and efficiently, focusing on the task at hand and the goal that lies ahead.



As you run, the terrain becomes progressively steeper and more difficult to navigate. The air grows thinner, making it harder to breathe. But despite these challenges, you press on, driven by the hope of finding the Bag of Truth.



After what feels like hours of running, you finally spot a glint of light in the distance - the sun reflecting off a metallic object. As you get closer, you realize that it's a small chest, intricately decorated with gold and silver filigree.



You have found the Bag of Truth!



What would you like to do?



A) Open the chest and claim the Bag of Truth.

B) Search the area for potential traps or dangers before opening the chest.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 5 events remaining with 15 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 10 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: "At last!" I cry. "The Bag of Truth!" My heart is racing, but I know I must be cautious. Are there any traps around? Does the Bag of Truth look real? I spend about 1 minute doing this.
**ASSISTANT**: You approach the chest with caution, scanning the area for any potential traps or dangers. After a quick assessment, you don't notice anything out of the ordinary - no tripwires, no pressure plates, and no signs of tampering.



As you examine the chest more closely, you notice that it appears to be real and not a fake. The gold and silver filigree are intricately detailed, and the chest itself feels solid and heavy in your hands.



After a minute of careful examination, you feel confident that the Bag of Truth is genuine and safe to claim.



What would you like to do?



A) Open the chest and claim the Bag of Truth.

B) Take a moment to catch your breath before opening the chest.



Remember, every action costs time, and there are 5 events remaining with 14 minutes remaining. You have regained some health points but are still down 10 from the wolf attack.
**USER**: With quivering hands, I pick up The Bag of Truth!
**ASSISTANT**: You take a deep breath and reach for the chest, feeling your heart pounding in your chest. With quivering hands, you slowly lift the lid and peer inside.



What you see takes your breath away - a small, shimmering bag made of what appears to be woven gold, with intricate embroidery along its edges. You carefully pick up the bag, feeling its weight and the way it glimmers in the sunlight.



You have found the Bag of Truth!
