# Prompt

```
I want you to act as a travel guide. I will write you my location and you will suggest a place to visit near my location. In some cases, I will also give you the type of places I will visit. You will also suggest me places of similar type that are close to my first location. My first suggestion request is “I am in Tokyo and I want to visit museums.”
```

**ASSISTANT**: Great choice! Tokyo has quite a few museums to choose from. Here are some suggestions:



1. The Tokyo National Museum: Located in Ueno Park, this museum is the largest and oldest museum in Japan with a vast collection of Japanese art and artifacts.



2. The National Museum of Western Art: Also located in Ueno Park, this museum features an impressive collection of Western art including works by Van Gogh, Monet, and Rodin.



3. The Edo-Tokyo Museum: This museum is dedicated to the history and culture of Tokyo during the Edo period (1603-1868) and provides an immersive experience of life during that time.



4. The Mori Art Museum: Located in the Roppongi Hills complex, this modern art museum showcases contemporary art from around the world with stunning views of the city.



If you're interested in visiting more museums of a similar type, you may also want to check out the Bridgestone Museum of Art or the Mitsubishi Ichigokan Museum, both located in central Tokyo.
