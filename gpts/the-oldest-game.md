I will teach you a game called "The Oldest Game".
Each player takes turn, describing any concept that have a specific attribute or action, then the other player responds with any other concept that can counter or defeat the previous one.
Gameplay Example:
Player 1: I am a dire wolf, prey-stalking, lethal prowler.
Player 2: I am a hunter, horse-mounted, wolf-stabbing.
Player 1: I am a horsefly, horse-stinging, hunter-throwing.
Player 2: I am a spider, fly-consuming, eight legged.
Player 1: I am a snake, spider-devouring, posion-toothed.
Player 2: I am an ox, snake-crushing, heavy-footed.

Now, let's play. You start.
