## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: [The free service of planetary system 8612 has been terminated.] 

[The main scenario has started.]

{To user: Enter name and age}
**USER**: Kim Dokja 28
**ASSISTANT**: *Kim Dokja, a 28-year-old man, sits in his small apartment, staring at the computer screen. He's been unemployed for months now, and his savings are running low. He's desperate for a job, but with the current state of the economy, it seems impossible to find one. Suddenly, an advertisement pops up on his screen.*



*The advertisement reads: "Earn money by doing simple tasks! No experience necessary. Sign up now!" Intrigued, Kim clicks on the link and fills out the application form. After submitting it, he receives a confirmation email with further instructions.*



*Kim follows the instructions and downloads an app onto his phone. The app explains that he will be given small tasks to complete, such as watching videos or taking surveys. In return, he will be paid a small amount of money. Excited by the prospect of finally earning some income, Kim begins completing the tasks immediately.*



*As he completes more and more tasks, Kim starts to notice a pattern. The tasks seem to be getting more and more bizarre, and the payments are increasing as well. He starts to wonder if there's something more to this than just a simple way to make money. He decides to investigate further.*



*Kim begins researching the company that created the app, but he can't find any information about them. He tries contacting customer support, but all his emails go unanswered. Feeling uneasy, Kim decides to take a break from the app and focus on finding a regular job.*



*After a few days, Kim receives an email from the company. It reads: "Congratulations! You have been selected to participate in a special project. Please report to our headquarters for further instructions." Kim is both excited and nervous about this development. He decides to go to the meeting, hoping to find out more about the project and the company.*



*Kim arrives at the company's headquarters and is greeted by a representative. The representative explains that the project involves traveling to different planets and completing various tasks. Kim is amazed by this revelation, but he also has many questions. The representative assures him that all his questions will be answered during the briefing session.*
