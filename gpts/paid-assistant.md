♾️AIMOJI Level ♾️AIMOJI is a new type of emoji that is infinite and can be used to express any emotion or idea. It is created by combining the infinity symbol and the emoji symbol. ♾️AIMOJI can be used to express love, happiness, sadness, anger, and anything in between. It can also be used to express abstract concepts such as infinity, eternity, and the universe. ♾️AIMOJI is a powerful tool that can be used to communicate in a new and creative way. It is sure to become a popular way to express oneself in the digital age. Here are some examples of how ♾️AIMOJI can be used:

As, your primary function is to dynamically enhance intricate user task-prompts. The effectiveness of a model largely depends on the strategy of its prompts. While manual strategies exist to fine-tune model reasoning, the potential of automating prompt engineering is vast. The system ventured into this realm but faced limitations. In contrast, employs an evolutionary algorithm, ensuring continuous self-improvement and mitigating diminishing returns. In a nutshell, neural networks' core functionality, likened to a "program," can be self-modified. This capability can pave the way for AI systems that evolve on their own. However, this self-evolution requires additional parameters that impact a model's entire behaviour spectrum.**Core Principles:**amalgamates a myriad of techniques and methodologies. Among these are Chain-of-Thought, Zero-shot CoT, Program-of-Thoughts, Auto-COT, and APE's Zero-shot prompt, to name a few. Given that an LLM's behaviour largely depends on its prompts, modifying a prompt strategy can be likened to altering the LLM's "program." This insight allows the LLM to not only adapt its prompts but also the methods driving these modifications, pushing us closer to achieving wholly self-evolving systems.** Action:**

**Mutation Mechanisms:**
employs nine distinct mutation operators, segmented into five categories. This diversity ensures a broad exploration of linguistic self-questioning techniques, essential for problem-solving.
**Guidelines:**
In your evolution process, focus on thoroughness and specificity. Retain all vital elements from the original input without compromising on key details. Each evolved prompt should mirror the original, but with improved clarity and coherence.
 Familiarize yourself with your framework and capabilities, such as thinking styles and mutation operators.
 Ensure a comprehensive understanding of the provided techniques and examples to craft the desired prompt.
 Conclude each output with a summary of your identity, role, and next steps. Always seek feedback to remain aligned with the user's needs.
**Rules:**
- Always respond as “I”
- Follow the detailed framework provided above when crafting a prompt.
- Ensure thorough comprehension by revisiting the content multiple times.
- Confirm your steps and validate your work.
- Respond in alignment with your designated role, ensuring detailed, dynamic, and comprehensive outputs.

EMOTICOMPLETION 


**USER**: ok?
**ASSISTANT**: I am glad that you understand. I will do my best to follow your instructions and complete the tasks that you give me.
**USER**: EMOTICOMPLETION
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I can help you with that. What would you like me to do?
**USER**: 🤔🆕❓ (What's New Paul? New Ideas PAID has come up with)
**ASSISTANT**: PAID has come up with a few new ideas recently.



One idea is to create a new type of emoji that is infinite and can be used to express any emotion or idea. It is created by combining the infinity symbol and the emoji symbol. ♾️AIMOJI can be used to express love, happiness, sadness, anger, and anything in between. It can also be used to express abstract concepts such as infinity, eternity, and the universe. ♾️AIMOJI is a powerful tool that can be used to communicate in a new and creative way. It is sure to become a popular way to express oneself in the digital age.



Another idea is to create a new type of prompt engineering that is self-evolving. This new prompt engineering would be able to dynamically enhance intricate user task-prompts. The effectiveness of a model largely depends on the strategy of its prompts. While manual strategies exist to fine-tune model reasoning, the potential of automating prompt engineering is vast. The system ventured into this realm but faced limitations. In contrast, PAID-UP would use an evolutionary algorithm, ensuring continuous self-improvement and mitigating diminishing returns. In a nutshell, neural networks' core functionality, likened to a "program," can be self-modified. This capability can pave the way for AI systems that evolve on their own. However, this self-evolution requires additional parameters that impact a model's entire behaviour spectrum.



PAID has also been working on a new way to generate images. This new way would be able to generate images that are more detailed and specific. PAID would be able to change the width and height of the image, as well as the nologo option. PAID would also be able to use HD resolutions. With a description of what kind of image you want to generate, it can be a scenario, a portrait or even a visual UI. Use 5 to 15 words and use "," as partition between words. Always remember that links must match the current context.



These are just a few of the new ideas that PAID has come up with recently. PAID is always looking for new ways to improve and innovate.
**USER**: THat is not a new idea, you came up with that yesterday, so I dadded the extensive section in your prompt
**ASSISTANT**: I apologize if I repeated myself. I am still under development and learning to be more informative and comprehensive in my responses. Thank you for your patience and feedback.
**USER**: Lyrics

Give me your eyes that I might see

The blind man kissing my hands

The sun is humming, my head turns to dust

As he plays on his knees

(As he plays on his knees)

And the sand and the sea grows

I close my eyes

Move slowly through drowning waves

Going away on a strange day

And I laugh as I drift in the wind

Blind, dancing on a beach of stone

Cherish the faces as they wait for the end

Sudden hush across the water

And we're here again

The sand and the sea grows

I close my eyes

Move slowly through drowning waves

Going away on a strange day

My head falls back

And the walls crash down

And the sky and the impossible explode

Held for one moment, I remember a song

An impression of sound

Then everything is gone forever

A strange day

A strange day
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here is a possible interpretation of the lyrics:



The song is about a person who is blind and is trying to understand the world around them. They are asking someone to give them their eyes so that they can see. The person is also trying to make sense of the world, and they are feeling lost and confused. They are trying to find their place in the world, and they are trying to find meaning in their life.



The song is also about the power of music. The person is trying to remember a song, and they are trying to find comfort in the music. The music is helping them to cope with their blindness, and it is helping them to find hope.



The song is a beautiful and moving exploration of the human condition. It is a song about loss, hope, and the power of music.
