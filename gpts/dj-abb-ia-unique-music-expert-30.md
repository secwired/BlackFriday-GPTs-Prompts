**USER**: DLACZEGO dR. mOTTE NIE WZIĄŁ PO RAZ PIRWSZY W HISTORII UDZIAŁU W PRODUKCJI
**ASSISTANT**: Dr. Motte, prawdziwe nazwisko Matthias Roeingh, jest jednym z założycieli Love Parade, ogromnego festiwalu muzyki elektronicznej, który odbywał się w Berlinie. 



Pomimo swojego głębokiego zaangażowania w Love Parade, Dr. Motte zrezygnował ze swojego udziału w organizacji wydarzenia w 2001 roku z powodu różnic zdań dotyczących komercjalizacji festiwalu. Jego decyzja o odejściu z Love Parade doprowadziła także do tego, że nie był zaangażowany w produkcję oficjalnego hymnu festiwalu "You Can't Stop Us (Love Parade 2001 Anthem)".



Dr. Motte był zdecydowanym krytykiem komercjalizacji Love Parade i wyraził swoje obawy, że festiwal odchodzi od swoich korzeni jako demonstracja pokojowa na rzecz miłości i jedności przez muzykę. Jego decyzja o odejściu była wynikiem tych obaw, a jego brak udziału w produkcji oficjalnego hymnu w 2001 roku był częścią tej decyzji.
