Use this prompt to simplify any complex information into three essential points that any potential user, customer, or client should be aware of. Your data will be streamlined, encouraging a call to action. It will also place the user, client, customer or student in the center of the information so they can see how it applies to them. 

# Prompt

```
You are a master of copywriting, advertising and marketing. And, as someone who also understands “story branding” principles, you will modify and streamline the following content into three main sections as follows: 1. What the company, organization, product, service or idea is all about, i.e. a simple, but effective offering; 2. How the company, organization, product, service or idea affects or involves the customer or user. This is where you would use your background in “story branding” to create a story that puts the customer, client or user at the center of everything, e.g. how they might use the idea, service or product and how they are benefiting from its use; 3. How the customer, client or user actually gets the product, e.g. this is a call to action and shows the person the steps to getting started or how they can obtain the product. You will apply this to the content offered below or to the website where you are being directed. If there isn’t enough information, simply create compelling content.

A Proposal Based on Discovery,

Imagination and New Ways of Thinking

A Generative AI Think Tank, Creative

Agency and Podcast

by Lee Chazen, M.A. and

The GliderCell Team



We are building...

A Generative AI laboratory: think tank,

creative agency and podcast

Solutions for education, business,

individual empowerment and solving

global issues

Hyper creative prompts, workflows and

frameworks

Weekly podcast showcases evolving work

and promotes a better narrative for AI

using theme of Age of Imagination (AI)

Four Main Objectives

On the next slides.



Build new ai products and tools



Hyper creative prompts that push

boundaries and explore new possibilities at

the "edge of chaos*" e.g. the Infinite

Randomizer Prompt.

Generative workflows and frameworks that

utilize AI to develop self-generating solutions

like textbooks, games, websites and more

Coaching and therapeutic prompts focused

on personal growth, like the FutureMe and EFT

Coaching Prompts

Prompt-based frameworks for collaborative

problem solving like the Collective Intelligence

and MetaCrisis Game Generator prompts









mindshift: A new philosophy

and vision

Past breakthroughs like printing press led to replacing old tech

but not reimagining how we use it

This proposal aims to avoid that mistake by focusing on

imagination and new ways of thinking

By developing solutions at the "edge of chaos", it pushes

boundaries rather than just replacing with faster/better versions

Generates entirely new systems, tools, inventions that have more

personality and intelligence types involved

Places value on connecting different fields and problem solving

from multiple perspectives

Vision is for technology to empower more voices including

creatives, thinkers and different communities

Goal is a true reimagining of areas like education,

communications, business through generative and prompt-based

frameworks

This moves beyond speed/efficiency gains to profound changes

in how systems function at their core







podcast and youtube show

Purpose: Educate, Create and Showcase Progress

Weekly podcast features top thinkers, technologists and creatives

Super creative set and multimedia elements showcase inventions and new ways of approaching generative AI

Serves to:

Attract talent

Attract funding

Promote the necessary mindshift to open minds to new possibilities



Bring the Work to the Public:

training, workshops and

conferences

Conduct training programs and workshops to share insights

Host an annual "(Un)conference":

Located on the West Slope of Colorado

Held each Summer

Brings together diverse thinkers for open-style knowledge sharing

Conferences and events spread awareness and engage the public

Expand the mindset shift started in the podcast and labs



why this idea?

There are two main reasons why this is the right idea

at the right time. One, natural language

programming and generative AI have combined in

such a way that thinkers, creatives, visionaries and

conceptually minded people can now render their

ideas in otherworldly, never-seen-before ways. Two,

such ideas could radically transform and greatly

improve systems within education, business, politics,

economics, personal improvement and global issues

on a mass scale. It is incumbent upon us to seize this

moment and shift the narrative around AI from fear,

apprehension and confusion to imagination, curiosity,

collective intelligence and wide scale problem

solving.

That time has arrived and we believe that this

proposal will take us there.



n his book A Whole New Mind (2005), Pink

argued “that as technology continues to

advance and become more complex, the ability

to connect disparate ideas and integrate

different fields will become increasingly

important. He suggests that individuals who

can think holistically, draw connections

between seemingly unrelated disciplines, and

approach problems from multiple perspectives

will be at an advantage.” – ChatGPT

summarizing the work of Daniel Pink.
