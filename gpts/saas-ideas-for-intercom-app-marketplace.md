**ASSISTANT**: 1. A/B Testing for Intercom Messages: Develop a feature that allows Intercom users to test various versions of their messages to see which performs better with their audience. This will help them optimize their messaging and increase user engagement. The feature can be implemented using Intercom's API and third-party A/B testing tools, and revenue can be generated by offering it as a paid add-on to existing Intercom plans.



2. Automated Triggered Surveys: Build a tool that automatically sends out surveys to users based on certain triggers, such as after completing a specific action or when they haven't been active in the app for a certain period of time. This will help Intercom users gather valuable feedback from their users and improve engagement. The tool can be implemented using Intercom's API and integrated with popular survey platforms like SurveyMonkey or Typeform. Revenue can be generated by offering the tool as a subscription-based product.



3. Gamification and Rewards System: Develop a gamification system that allows Intercom users to incentivize and reward their users for taking certain actions, such as referring new users, completing certain tasks, or engaging with the app regularly. This will help improve user engagement and retention. The system can be implemented using Intercom's API and integrated with popular rewards programs like Smile.io or LoyaltyLion. Revenue can be generated by offering the system as a paid add-on to existing Intercom plans.
