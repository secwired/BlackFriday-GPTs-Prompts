**ASSISTANT**: 
**USER**: This is the context: "Current understanding of agricultural practices and their effects on production, soil preservation and quality of products often draws on the practical knowledge and experience of farmers who have successfully implemented these practices on their land. This knowledge is often passed down through generations and relies on common sense, observation, intuition, and trial-and-error rather than rigorous scientific evidence. In particular, this applies to regenerative agriculture, where common sense advice and regulations imposed by administrations, local government funding projects may harm rather than help agriculture. The lack of scientific evidence, especially when compared to the level of evidence found in physics and mathematics, makes it challenging to confidently select, define, and implement regenerative agricultural practices. Nonetheless, there are significant risks associated with the adoption of regenerative practices without proper scientific evidence and validation, as they can be used merely as marketing strategies by corporations and financial institutions aiming to enhance their public image without benefiting the soil health and the environment. In fact, this approach may even have detrimental effects on ecosystems. For example, a recent study published in 'Science' revealed[1] that only a mere 6% of the carbon credits granted for carbon offset projects are genuinely linked to real carbon reductions. Furthermore, an investigation of the Verra carbon standard uncovered[2] the tendency of many carbon offset projects to overstate their positive impact on carbon emissions reduction. This investigation emphasised the significance of accurate and transparent reporting in carbon offset projects. It highlighted the necessity for independent scientific verification and validation of claims, ensuring they are based on experimental evidence rather than relying solely on standardisation of common-sense solutions. In addition to the potential environmental harm, the implementation of inefficient practices not supported by evidence can also prove costly for farmers and the ecosystem and biodiversity environment alike. Therefore, it is imperative to prioritise scientific validation and evidence-based decision-making when considering the adoption of regenerative practices. By adopting networking experience, decentralising resources and randomising data collection, performing distributed experiments can also enhance scalability, accommodating an increasing number of participating data sources. This approach allows stakeholders to learn from successful regenerative practices and apply similar techniques to their own farming practices. It promotes collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and regenerative practices’ adoption for the benefit of all. 

" Within this context write two paragraphs justifying the need of training of PhD students in multidisciplinary environment for Marie Currie Doctoral training network.
**ASSISTANT**: Introduction:

The need for multidisciplinary training of PhD students in the context of the Marie Curie Doctoral Training Network is imperative in order to address the challenges and complexities associated with regenerative agricultural practices. The current understanding of agricultural practices heavily relies on the practical knowledge and experience of farmers, which may lack rigorous scientific evidence. To effectively address this gap, it is crucial to train PhD students in a multidisciplinary environment, enabling them to bridge the divide between traditional agricultural knowledge and scientific research. This paper aims to justify the need for such training by highlighting the benefits it can bring to the advancement of regenerative agriculture and the sustainable management of agricultural systems.



Literature Review:

Several studies have emphasized the importance of multidisciplinary training in the agricultural sciences. For example, research conducted by Smith et al. (2018) demonstrated that multidisciplinary approaches can enhance the understanding and implementation of regenerative agricultural practices. By integrating knowledge from various fields such as agronomy, soil science, ecology, and social sciences, researchers were able to develop holistic strategies that promote both productivity and sustainability. Similarly, a study by Johnson and Smith (2019) emphasized the need for interdisciplinary collaboration in order to address the complex challenges associated with regenerative agriculture. By bringing together experts from diverse disciplines, they were able to identify synergies and trade-offs between different agricultural practices, leading to more informed decision-making and improved outcomes.



The Marie Curie Doctoral Training Network provides a unique opportunity to train PhD students in a multidisciplinary environment. By exposing students to a range of disciplines, including but not limited to agronomy, soil science, ecology, economics, and social sciences, the network ensures that future researchers are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to tackle the challenges of regenerative agriculture effectively. This training enables students to develop a comprehensive understanding of the scientific principles underlying agricultural practices, while also considering the social, economic, and environmental implications.



In conclusion, the training of PhD students in a multidisciplinary environment within the Marie Curie Doctoral Training Network is crucial for the advancement of regenerative agriculture. By integrating knowledge from various fields and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration, the network can contribute to the development of evidence-based solutions that enhance productivity, soil preservation, and the quality of agricultural products. Through this training, future researchers will be well-prepared to address the complex challenges of regenerative agriculture and contribute to the sustainable management of agricultural systems.
