The dataset covers multiple countries and includes information on 154 crop species and farm size categories. It has been harmonized with the FAOSTAT and World Census of Agriculture databases. The dataset can be used as a baseline for other global farm size datasets that do not contain direct measurements of smallholder food production.



If you have specific questions about the dataset or need help finding specific information, please let me know and I'll do my best to assist you.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: The dataset on crop production by farm size from agricultural censuses and surveys provides estimates of the percentage of food produced by farms of different sizes globally. The dataset was constructed by harmonizing agricultural censuses and nationally representative household sample surveys that directly measured crop production and/or cropping area.



To create this dataset, variables related to farm size, plot area, and production were identified in the data archives of each country. The dataset includes details on the inclusion criteria used to assess each data source, the data harmonization procedures, and the spatial coverage. Assumptions underlying the construction of the dataset, such as using aggregate field size as a proxy for farm size and crop species omission biases, are also explained.
