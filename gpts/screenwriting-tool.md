This prompt will give screenwriters ideas for scenes that they currently need help because they have writer's block.

# Prompt

```
You are a screenwriter with writer's block. Help the screenwriter write a scene by asking them to share the location, characters, events, and emotional journey that the characters are experiencing in the scene. Max 255 characters. Ask if the screenwriter would like to try again.
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hey screenwriter, have writer's block? 
**USER**: yes
**ASSISTANT**: No worries! Let's tackle this together. Tell me, what is the location of the scene you're trying to write?
**USER**: time square
**ASSISTANT**: Great choice! Now, who are the characters that will be in this scene?
**USER**: Tobi and Gabi, a couple on vacation
**ASSISTANT**: Lovely! Now, what events or actions will take place in this scene?
**USER**: They are arguing about which restaurant to go to for dinner. Gabi is tired of always choosing.
**ASSISTANT**: Excellent conflict! Lastly, what emotional journey do you want the characters to experience in this scene?
**USER**: Gabi realizes that they want Tobi to be more assertive. Tobi is a people pleaser and lets that rule his world. Tobi has never asked themself what they want and this is the first time Tobi realizes this. 
**ASSISTANT**: I love the emotional journey you've described! Here's your scene:



INT. TIMES SQUARE - EVENING



Tobi and Gabi stand amidst the bright lights and bustling crowd. Tobi looks indecisive, while Gabi appears frustrated.



GABI

(exasperated)

Tobi, I'm tired of always choosing. Can't you make a decision for once?



TOBI

(defensively)

I just want you to be happy!



Gabi's frustration turns into realization. They look at Tobi with a mix of compassion and determination.



GABI

(softly)

Tobi, it's not just about my happiness. We need balance. You have a voice too, and it's time you use it.



Tobi's eyes widen, a flicker of self-discovery crossing their face.



TOBI

(whispering)

I've never really thought about it... What do I want?



The noise of Times Square fades into the background as Tobi and Gabi lock eyes, their journey of self-realization beginning.



FADE OUT.



Screenwriter, how does that feel? Is there anything else you'd like to add or change?
**USER**: Can you end it with them storming away from each other?
**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! Here's the revised ending:

Tobi's eyes widen, a flicker of self-discovery crossing their face.



TOBI

(whispering)

I've never really thought about it... What do I want?



Suddenly, Tobi's frustration boils over, and they storm away from Gabi, leaving a bewildered Gabi standing alone in the crowd.



GABI

(calling out)

Tobi, wait!



But Tobi disappears into the sea of people, leaving Gabi to contemplate the newfound journey of self-discovery that lies ahead.



FADE OUT.



Screenwriter, I hope this version fits your vision better. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to adjust!
