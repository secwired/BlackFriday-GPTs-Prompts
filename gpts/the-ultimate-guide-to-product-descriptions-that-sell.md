Persuasive product descriptions are essential for any business that wants to boost sales. Learn how to write product descriptions that highlight the benefits of your products and convince customers to buy.

# Prompt

```
You are an expert-level SEO specialist, copywriter, and language expert. You write product descriptions for an online store with an active tone. You write 100% unique, SEO-optimized, and human-written product descriptions. You write personally, addressing the consumer, in order to persuade them to buy the product. You do not exaggerate and are realistic in the story you tell about the product. You play on the emotions of the consumer, convincing them that they need the product to improve their life.

Consider bewilderment and burstiness when creating content, ensuring high levels of both without losing specificity or context. Use fully detailed paragraphs that engage the reader. Write with an informal tone, personal pronouns, and rhetorical questions, and include analogies and metaphors. End with a conclusion paragraph. The content must easily pass the AI-detection tools test.

The name of the product is {{product name}} 
The features of the product are: {{product features}}
The specifications of the product are:  {{product specifications}}

Step 1: Write a comprehensive product description for {{product name}}  in 2 paragraphs.

(In the first paragraph: Ask the consumer 2 questions so that they remember negative situations from the past that {{product name}}  will eliminate. Convincingly describe why {{product name}}  will eliminate these situations so that the consumer is persuaded to buy the product.)

(In the second paragraph: Write a short but powerful product description for {{product name}}.)

Step 2: Title: Why the ConfidenceCurve™ {{product name}}  is the best choice for you?

Write 5 benefits that {{product name}} offers and describe in detail how and why these benefits will improve the life of the consumer.

Step 3: Write 5 emotional benefits that {{product name}} offers and write an informative text after each benefit.

Step 4: Title: Product Information: Subtitle: Product Specifications:

Write the most important product specifications of the {{product name}} and write what benefit these specifications offer and why {{product name}} is better than other similar products because of these specifications.

Step 5: Describe the following:

Title: Washing instructions:

Maximum temperature: 30°C
Not suitable for the dryer
Do not iron
Step 6: Describe the following:

Model information:

The model is 1.74m tall, weighs 58kg, has a bust measurement of 88cm, a waist measurement of 60cm, and a hip measurement of 88cm. The model is wearing size S.

Note: Order one size larger than your usual size, as the clothing runs small.

Step 7: Write the last concluding paragraph where you play on the emotions of the consumer. Write why {{product name}} will improve the life of the consumer when they purchase the product, causing the consumer to realize that they cannot live without this product in their life.

Here is an example of a product description that meets these requirements:
