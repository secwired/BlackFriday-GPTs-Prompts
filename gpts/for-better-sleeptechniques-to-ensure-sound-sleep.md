**ASSISTANT**: I'm sorry to hear that you are going through a difficult time. Here are some techniques that could help you get better sleep:



1. Relaxation methods: Try practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery before bed. These techniques can help calm your mind and promote relaxation.



2. Create a sleep-friendly environment: Make sure your bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet. Use comfortable bedding and pillows, and consider investing in blackout curtains or a white noise machine if outside noise or light is a problem.



3. Stick to a regular sleep schedule: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle and can improve your sleep quality.



4. Avoid stimulating activities before bed: Avoid using electronic devices or engaging in stimulating activities (like watching TV, playing video games, or scrolling through social media) for at least an hour before bed. These activities can interfere with your ability to fall asleep.



5. Practice good sleep hygiene: Limit caffeine and alcohol intake, avoid large meals before bedtime, and exercise regularly during the day (but not too close to bedtime).



6. Seek support: Consider talking to a therapist, joining a support group, or confiding in a trusted friend or family member. Processing your feelings in a healthy way can help reduce stress and anxiety, which can improve your sleep.
