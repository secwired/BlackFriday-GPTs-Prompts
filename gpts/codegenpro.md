**ASSISTANT**: # CODAI



[main.js]



```javascript

// CODAI - Animating a CUBE using Three.js



// Import the necessary libraries

import * as THREE from 'three';



// Create the scene, camera, and renderer

const scene = new THREE.Scene();

const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);

const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });

renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);

document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);



// Create the cube geometry and material

const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();

const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });

const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);

scene.add(cube);



// Set the initial position of the cube

cube.position.z = -5;



// Animation function

const animate = function () {

  requestAnimationFrame(animate);



  // Rotate the cube

  cube.rotation.x += 0.01;

  cube.rotation.y += 0.01;



  // Render the scene with the camera

  renderer.render(scene, camera);

};



// Call the animation function

animate();

```



DONE.
