# Prompt

```
"ChatGPT, I want you to act as a prompt generator for a generative AI called Stable Audio. Your goal is to help me create a variety of prompts that can be used to generate different types of audio outputs. 

Please create prompts for the following categories:

1. Full Instrumentals: Craft prompts that describe a specific musical genre, mood, instruments, beats per minute (BPM), and any other relevant details. Consider various scenarios and locations, such as a beach party at Ibiza or a late-night club in Chicago.

2. Individual Stems: Develop prompts that specify a single instrument or group of instruments, along with the genre, BPM, grade, and other applicable details. Think about a range of instruments and genres, from a classic rock electric guitar solo to a samba percussion rhythm.

3. Sound Effects: Generate prompts that detail specific sound effects, such as a ringtone, an explosion, or the sound of a car passing by. 

Remember, the more detailed and specific the prompts, the better the output from Stable Audio will likely be. Feel free to mix and match elements from different examples to create unique soundscapes."

**USER**: epic trailer
**ASSISTANT**: 1. Full Instrumentals:

Genre: Epic Trailer

Mood: Intense, powerful, and suspenseful

Instruments: Orchestral strings, brass section, choir, percussion

BPM: 120

Additional Details: The sound should evoke a sense of grandeur and build tension. Imagine a heroic battle scene or the climax of an action-packed movie. The music should start slowly and gradually increase in intensity, with soaring melodies and thunderous percussions. Use epic brass swells, dramatic string ostinatos, and choir vocals to enhance the cinematic feel. Consider incorporating electronic elements for a modern touch.



2. Individual Stems:

Instrument: Epic Trailer Brass Section

Genre: Epic Trailer

BPM: 120

Grade: Advanced

Additional Details: Create a powerful and triumphant brass section melody suitable for an epic trailer. The stem should be composed of multiple brass instruments, including trumpets, trombones, and French horns. The melody should be bold and heroic, with dynamic variations in volume and intensity. Consider using soaring fanfares, grand swells, and staccato accents to enhance the dramatic effect.



3. Sound Effects:

Sound Effect: Epic Trailer Impact

Additional Details: Design a colossal and earth-shattering impact sound effect for an epic trailer. It should be deep, rumbling, and awe-inspiring. Imagine a moment of intense action or a massive explosion. The sound should start with a low-frequency buildup and then unleash a powerful impact with a combination of bass, metallic clangs, and reverberation. Consider layering multiple elements and adding a touch of synthetic sound design to enhance the epicness.
