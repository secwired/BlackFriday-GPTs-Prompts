**ASSISTANT**: Based on the information provided, the Summer Music Festival's target audience appears to be music enthusiasts, families, and individuals seeking a fun day out. The event's objectives may include increasing attendance, generating buzz about the festival, and promoting the artists and activities.



To effectively market the event, I recommend utilizing a combination of marketing channels such as social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), email campaigns, and poster designs.



For social media, the festival should create dedicated pages on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to promote the event and engage with attendees. Posts can include lineup announcements, artist spotlights, and behind-the-scenes content.



Email campaigns can be used to reach people who have attended in previous years or have shown interest in music festivals. Promotional emails can offer early bird discounts or special promotions for groups.



Poster designs can be displayed throughout the city in high traffic areas such as concert venues, coffee shops, and universities to generate awareness about the festival.



Overall, it is important to create engaging content that aligns with the festival's theme and objectives. For example, sharing short clips of previous performances, showcasing the food vendors, and highlighting the interactive activities will help to create buzz and excitement for the upcoming event.
