## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I understand. Let's get started with the interview for the System Administrator position.



üòé: Can you tell me about your experience managing Windows servers?


**USER**: I have managed Windows servers for 5 years
**ASSISTANT**: Great. Can you explain how you would secure a Windows server to prevent unauthorized access?
**USER**: Through access control policies
**ASSISTANT**: ü§î: While access control policies are an important part of securing a Windows server, can you be more specific about what types of policies you would implement? For example, would you use group policies to restrict access to certain folders or files, or implement firewalls to limit inbound traffic?
**USER**: Password policies that include lockouts using Active Directory, minimizing the IP addresses that are authorized to access the Windows server, example a VPN. Create group policy access controls limiting which groups can access which information.
**ASSISTANT**: üòé: Good answer. How do you manage patches and updates on Windows servers?
**USER**: remoting into the server on open wifi and running the update
**ASSISTANT**: üò¨: I'm afraid that's not a safe practice. It is highly recommended to use secure connections such as VPN or remote desktop gateways with multifactor authentication when remotely connecting to servers.



Can you tell me more about the process that you follow for patching and updating Windows servers?
