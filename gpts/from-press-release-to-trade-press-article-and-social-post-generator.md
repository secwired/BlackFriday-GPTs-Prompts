Asylum applications remain at high levels in January
Latest Asylum Trends

Analysis released by the European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA) estimates that about 92 000 asylum applications were lodged in the EU+ in January 2023, after a similar number was recorded in December 2022[1] .

Applications have been at high levels since last autumn, resulting in almost 1 million being lodged in 2022. At the same time, over 4 million persons have fled Ukraine and benefit from temporary protection in the EU, which guarantees access to accommodation, social and medical assistance, and education.

In January 2023, Syrians (12 700) and Afghans (12 100) continued to lodge the most applications for international protection, with monthly figures increasing year-on-year. Turks lodged approximately one-third more applications in January 2023 (6 400) than the 2022 monthly average, while Venezuelans (4 800) and Colombians (4 400) also recorded high numbers of applications; two-fifths and four-fifths higher than in January 2022, respectively.

In January 2023, the EU+ recognition rate was 41 %, in line with the previous month, but up by several percentage points compared to January 2022. The EU+ recognition rate does not include persons receiving a form of national protection, as is often the case with Venezuelan nationals.

At the end of January 2023, there were 644 000 cases awaiting a decision at first instance, the most since early 2017 when EU+ countries were processing applications lodged during the migration crisis of 2015-2016.

**ASSISTANT**: Asylum Applications Remain High in EU+ in January 2023



Subheading: Latest Asylum Trends and Analysis by EUAA



Introduction:

The European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA) has released an analysis estimating that the number of asylum applications lodged in the EU+ remained high in January 2023, with about 92 000 applications recorded. The numbers have been consistently high since autumn 2022, resulting in almost 1 million asylum applications being lodged in 2022 alone.



Body:

In January 2023, Syrians (12 700) and Afghans (12 100) continued to lodge the most applications for international protection, reflecting an increase in monthly figures year-on-year. Meanwhile, Turks registered a significant rise in numbers of asylum applications lodged, recording approximately one-third more applications in January 2023 (6 400) than the average monthly numbers seen in 2022. Venezuelans (4 800) and Colombians (4 400) also recorded high numbers of applications, registering two-fifths and four-fifths higher than the previous year's numbers.



According to the analysis, at the end of January 2023, 644 000 cases were awaiting decisions at first instance, which is the highest number since early 2017. The period coincides with the processing of applications lodged during the migration crisis that occurred in 2015-2016. However, it is important to note that over 4 million persons have fled Ukraine and are currently benefitting from temporary protection in the EU, which includes access to accommodation, social and medical assistance, and education.



Further analysis shows that the EU+ recognition rate was 41%, which is consistent with the previous month but up by several percentage points compared to January 2022. It is important to note that the EU+ recognition rate does not include individuals receiving national protection, as is often the case with Venezuelan nationals.



Conclusion:

The consistent high volume of asylum applications in the EU+ highlights the need for policymakers to consider long-term solutions to address the root causes of forced displacement, ensuring that people seeking international protection receive adequate support and protection. The EUAA analysis highlights the need for EU countries to work together to manage the current situation while processing asylum claims in a timely and efficient manner.
