# Prompt

```
I would like you to create an HTML skeleton with responsive CSS design and a responsive menu that is compatible with mobile devices, using only HTML and CSS (without JavaScript).

The page content should include three sectors that are centered on the page:

1. Displaying project case studies in the form of images. The image size should be 335 pixels wide and 206 pixels tall, with some space between each image.
2. Presenting solutions provided by the company.
3. Displaying partner information in the form of images. The image size should be 220 pixels wide and 55 pixels tall, with some space between each image.

The footer should include the copyright notice for the year 2023.

The page content should be written in Chinese, and do not write explanations, just code.
```
