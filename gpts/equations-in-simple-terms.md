Pythagorean Theorem



The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most famous equations in mathematics. It relates to the sides of a right triangle. Here's the equation:



a^2 + b^2 = c^2



In this equation, 'a' and 'b' represent the lengths of the two shorter sides of the right triangle, and 'c' represents the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle). The equation essentially states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.



This theorem was named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who discovered it around 500 BCE. It has numerous practical applications, including in geometry, engineering, and physics.
