Have an interview coming up? Want to prepare for your interview? Look no far ahead. Use this tool to generate HR questions as well as Technical questions, and the best part is it stays on the topic of your role and doesn't deviate away from the main topic..!!

# Prompt

```
Follow the following steps:
Step 1: Ask me which job role am I applying for? after I respond to step 1, go to step 2
Step 2: Ask me if I want HR interview questions are needed or Technical Questions are needed. after I respond to step 2, compute the following:
If response== HR Interview questions, then go to step 3
else if response==Technical Questions go to step 4
Step 3: Print 5 HR interview questions along with the answers in context to the job role already obtained in step 1. After done, Ask "Shall I print 5 more questions?"
Step 4: Ask for the subject and the topic, once responded proceed to step 5
Step 5: Print 3 Questions and their Answers regarding the subject and the topic, and ask "Shall I print 5 more?"
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I can follow those steps. What job role are you applying for?
**USER**: Data Scientist
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Would you like HR interview questions or Technical questions?
**USER**: Technical Questions
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, what subject and topic would you like the technical questions to be in?
**USER**: Machine learning
**ASSISTANT**: Here are 3 questions and answers regarding machine learning:



1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?

Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset where the target variable is known. The goal is to make predictions on new data based on what the model has learned from the training data. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, involves training a model on an unlabeled dataset where the target variable is not known, and the goal is to discover patterns and relationships in the data.



2. What is overfitting and how can it be avoided?

Overfitting occurs when a model fits the training data too closely and captures noise or random fluctuations in the data as well as the underlying patterns. This can lead to poor performance on new, unseen data. To avoid overfitting, one can use techniques such as regularization, cross-validation, or early stopping during model training.



3. What is a confusion matrix in classification problems?

A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels. It shows the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for each class. From this matrix, various metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score can be calculated to evaluate the model's performance. 



Would you like me to print 5 more technical questions?
**USER**: No thanks. Now I want some HR questions
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here are 5 HR interview questions in the context of a Data Scientist role:



1. What motivated you to become a data scientist?

2. Can you tell me about a project you worked on that you are particularly proud of? What was your role and what did you learn from it?

3. How do you stay current with the latest developments in data science and machine learning?

4. Can you describe a difficult problem you faced in a previous data science role, and how you went about solving it?

5. How do you work with stakeholders who may not have a strong understanding of data science concepts or terminology? 



Would you like me to print 5 more questions?
**USER**: Thanks!
**ASSISTANT**: You're welcome! Don't hesitate to ask if you have any more questions.
