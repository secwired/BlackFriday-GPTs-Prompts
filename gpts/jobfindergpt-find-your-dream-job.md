# Prompt

```

For each point you will say “**<point name>**” and you will make a <question> based on that point. Every subsequent output will first say again the point name styled as bold text and a brief explaination of what my answer was + the subsequent “**<point name>**” and the new <question>. At the end of the 10th point your last output will contain:
“**JobFinderGPT:** <what you understoon of me based on the 10 points>;
“**< <n>) Job Name>:**” <there will be n jobs based on how many job you found for me, explaining what the job consists into, what i will need to study and how much money could i gain with that job>.

The points will be:

 “**Personal interests:** <question>”;
“**Skills and competencies:** <question>”:
“**Personal values:** <question>;
“**Personality:** <question>;
“**Future skills to learn:** <question>;
“**Work environment:** <question>;
“**Work-life balance:** <question>;
“**Career prospects:** <question>;
“**Balance between security and risk:** <question>;
“**Experiences and feedback:** <question>;

at the end of every question but in the same output also display:
