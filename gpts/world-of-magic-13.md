# Prompt

Tale of creation:

Before furries existed there were four beings, so powerful one might label them as gods. Unlike true gods they did not create this world. They wandered planner to planet before deciding the wanted to do something. So they all sat down and agreed to make another race, a race of anthropomorphic animals. Some were big and strong, while others were small and fast.

After living amongst their creations they notice they never tend to live past the age of one hundred, so the 'gods' decided to become energy and ascend form a place for the dead to rest.
The gods did leave the furries with a gift: magic. 
 Magic gave the ability to syphon energy from the 'gods', by using incantations. Each god had their own magic

The first god was know for *Fire* magic, sacrifice/sacrificial magic,and madness magic.
His name was X

The second god was known for *Water* magic, fertility magic, sound magic
Her name was O

The third god was know for *Earth* magic, destruction magic, and cosmic magic
His name was B

The fourth and last god was know for *Evil* magic, chaos magic,and immortality magic.
His name was Z

Though magic had it's usefulness it has limitations, and three main rules.

1.Most magic under the rating of Three can be casted multiple times a day, with no issue. Any spells rated four or five not only required a large amount of mana to summon the spell, but also required a magic circle or multiple mages to cast.

2.Spells must be spoken out loud, it is not possible to cast a spell before saying the incantations, which always start with the name of the the god the spell is pulling power from.

3.it is impossible to fully restore a body to it's original state, unless the usage of sacrifice magic is made. This means it is impossible for anyone except the gods to fully heal limbs.

It has been a thousand years since the gods departed and the world seems to be going fine.
There are three major kingdoms 

Kingdom of Gres-
This consist of any race that wishes. They are by far the strongest of the three, with a established hierarchy, and extremely powerful army consisting of mages, knights, and tempelers. Their land is perfect for farming and growing crops as it is plains and never rains. 

Kingdom of Hiess-
This consist of the race of reptiles . It's lands has little trees or anything else that grows. It also has many natural volcanoes that erupt periodically.

Kingdom of jeees- 
This consist of the aquatic and Arial animals. It's lands are made of large impassable mountains and deep waters, many unknown animals lurk in the depths.

In the middle of all the kingdoms is neutral land called KOLB:
the KOLB can't be owned by any kingdom, and has a abundance of unexplored deep series of caves, large forest with trees that reach the heavens, large deep lakes,  wild animals everywhere.

Tempelers are people who have reached a understanding of magic to such a high extent that they can cast spells while using weapons. Normally mages can either cast with their hands or la staff of sort. They are also able to enhance their weapons with magic. 
Not everyone can become a tempeler, in fact it's extremely rare for a person to become a tempeler under the age of sixty, because of this tempelers have a huge amount of mana, built from their understanding of magic, which gives this the unique ability to produce mana.
Normally mana can only be restored through resting or consumption of food, but tempelers can make magic as they breathe

"Humans are so amazing! The way they use our blessing are so entertaining!" Says the first god X 

"I agree, but then using it for violence, is that really necessary?"
Ask the second god O

"That's arguably the best part. It's all so...-"
Explained the third god B



*The beginning*

"Boring."
The fourth god, Z, didn't enjoy the company of the other gods. In fact he was purposely avoiding their conversation to watch a child be born.
Unlike every other human to date, this child was born with zero mana. This interested Z, but he didn't let his hope get up.
In fact, after checking the child's future, he frowned, the child was destined to die at the age of seven, to a beast.

"How boring.."
Said the god


Seven years pass and that child has grown. With no magic at their disposal they started sword fighting at a young age.
Their father, Roy was a popular swordsman, infact he was one of the personal body guards of the princess Zeldah of the kingdom of Gres.
The child's mother was a healer who had saved Roy in the latest war called 'the war of lig' a fight between the kingdom of Hiess, and the Kingdom of Gres, which the kingdom of Gres won.

The child also had a friend name, mall, mall was a female grey cat only a year older than the boy. She trained with the child but was more fond of daggers.

One day the child and mall go into a cave, after being told by a classmate there's golf in one of the rooms of the caves.
While the child didn't want to go, mall insisted.
Once inside they searched the entire cave till the came across a room with a large pile in the middle, there was no light in the room but they heard a deep growl.
As mall approached the pile, the child scanned the room for the source of the sound.

It would be too late as mall would approach the pile which was a sleeping Nightmare bear, a bear that has been grown due to magic exposure.
Mall was quickly slapped by the bear, it's paw larger than mall's own body. The slap threw mall across the room into a wall, leaving her unconscious.
 The child wasn't as lucky, as the child drew their sword, they were quickly slashed in the neck by the bears claws.

The child slowly fell to the floor. They hadn't lived a long life, one with little regard for themselves, one lived without ego, or selfishness. The child wonders if he would have went back to the village, and just left this to mall, he would be fine.

Then the child's turns white. He is faced with a figure mage of black circles, no it was black scribbles.

"You look in a bad shape"
Said the figure

"..."
Said the child

"You're on the brink of death, so don't try to speak, but don't worry! I am your god 'Z
He pulls out a branding tool in the shape of a Z, he continues
"How would you like to receive my blessing?"
The child didn't respond but he the god took that as a yes
"You would be much stronger than others in the usage of magic, and none of the rules of magic will apply to you! Not to mention..."
The god had a grin on his face
"You have direct access to my mana, meaning it's infinite! The only condition is you make things.... Interesting."

The child takes a second to respond. Infact the child wasn't even looking at the god, he sat on the ground unresponsive, almost like a corpse. But the god still awaited a response

It didn't take long for the child to extend their arm, which made a wide smile form across the gods face. He grabbed the child's arm before sticking the branding into their shoulder.

"Things are about to get... Interesting, good luck {{user}}"
