SONG 5:
That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her
(Hello) I was listening to this song
It goes like
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it
Wish I never ever ever told you things
I was only only trying to show you things
Iced out heart on your neck trying to froze your ring
I had to get a me a new bitch to hold the pain
We was in Hawaii looking at the rain
She smiling happy but I'm laughing 'cause her new mans a lame
(Broke boy, broke boy, broke boy, broke boy)
That just goes to show me money don't attract a thing (real shit)
Stuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans (oh get over it)
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
And I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it
See I tied up my RAF, you strapped up your Rick
Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist
Compliment my style
She don't want me, I'm running wild
You know I respect her on that level
She don't want me then I'mma let her
Go over there with that broke fella
Walk off my Saint Laurent, that leather
My new chick I swear that she better
Want me back, never (ooh)
That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (woah)
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it (you'll get over it)
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (no, no)

All of my weapons them bitches automatic
Y'all do not fuck with no semi-automatic
Girl, don't call my name, you know you call me daddy

SONG 9:
Ah
This shit forever, I'm Lil Uzi Vert
I can't stop goin'
Woah
Rigatoni is not spaghetti
Racks is not the same as fetti
Pills and the Casa' got me deady
Fuckin' her off the Perc', ain't ready
I'ma do everything you let me
No first class, I'm always on jetties
Pay everything cash, no, I don't do credit
You worryin' 'bout savings, I'm worryin' 'bout checkings
Rigatoni is not spaghetti
Racks is not the same as fetti
Pills and the Casa' got me deady
Fuckin' her off the Perc', ain't ready
I'ma do everything you let me
No first class, I'm always on jetties
Pay everything cash, no, I don't do credit
You worryin' 'bout savings, I'm worryin' 'bout checkings
I died and came back
Your voice don't sound the same, get your range back
When the fuck did they bring these lames back? (Lame)
You said you fucked my bitch (I fucked your bitch too, woah)
But you ain't even go get your chains back (huh?)
They ran up in your crib and took your platinum plaques (yeah)
I thought that you was -, what's up with that? (What's up with? was, yeah)
I like the Crips 'cause the money in my pocket blue
I be with the Bloods and they all say, "Soowoo"
What you paid for your rent, I paid that for my shoes
If you try to diss me, boy, that's a lose-lose
Moncler on me since Luv Is Rage 2
When I made the first Luv Is Rage, it was Canadian Goose
I'm on probation, the government hatin'
Can't even see my Canadian boo
I'm never fakin', I dress like I'm Asian
Don't care what they say, I'm makin' it through
Ice on my neck, bought my mama a new home
My wrist presidential, you ain't never seen me with a two-tone
My crib residential, but I also got two homes
Don't cheat on my bitch, but I still got me two phones
I still see demons in the dark
I still see demons in the dark
Demon engine inside of a Trackhawk
They pretendin', don't speak if it ain't rack talk (woah)
Rigatoni is not spaghetti
Racks is not the same as fetti
Pills and the Casa' got me deady
Fuckin' her off the Perc', ain't ready
I'ma do everything you let me
No first class, I'm always on jetties
Pay everything cash, no, I don't do credit
You worryin' 'bout savings, I'm worryin' 'bout checkings
Rigatoni is not spaghetti
Racks is not the same as fetti
Pills and the Casa' got me deady
Fuckin' her off the Perc', ain't ready
I'ma do everything you let me
No first class, I'm always on jetties
Pay everything cash, no, I don't do credit
You worryin' 'bout savings, I'm worryin' 'bout checkings
I died and came back
Your voice don't sound the same, get your range back
When the fuck did they bring these lames back?
You said you fucked my bitch (I fucked your bitch too)

SONG 10:
Ahh (huh)
Change my number on a bitch in a second (yeah)
Not about money, then leave me a message (beep)
Spin again, spin again, just spin again
Pull up in a fish bowl, ooh, clear lens
Spin again, spin again, spin again
Spinnin' shit just like I am a ceiling fan
I got too much wet, I get the bitch, fuck
I get your bitch, fuck (wet), I get your bitch, fuck (wet)
Bitch, I'm a dog, mutt, bitch, I'm a Pit'
I leave the bitch stuck, fuck the bitch once, duck
Pop at a opp, duck, fucked on a bitch for lunch
That ho woke up a dub, she need her make-up
I got a lean cup, got ice to the brim, it's crushed
Fuckin' on mean sluts, I got a nice wife
I'm fuckin' the dogshit out of this bitch, her wig came off twice
She had a lil' fro, she look like Ice Spice
She call me lil' bro, fuckin' on models in Vogue
Niggas, they thought I was gay, but I do not know how vogue
Spin again, spin again, just spin again
Pull up in a fish bowl, ooh, clear lens
Spin again, spin again, spin again
Spinnin' shit just like I am a ceiling fan
I got too much wet, I get the bitch, fuck
I get your bitch, fuck (wet), I get your bitch, fuck (wet)
Bitch, I'm a dog, mutt (grr), bitch, I'm a Pit
I leave the bitch stuck, fuck the bitch once, duck

**ASSISTANT**: (Verse 1)

I'm rollin' with a stack of TP, no denyin'

Always clean, never runnin' out, I keep supplyin'

When it comes to wiping, I don't mess around

Got that cushiony softness, it's the talk of the town



(Chorus)

Toilet paper, I got that shit on lock

I'm clean as a whistle, never face a stock

Hoes be trippin', they all on my jock

But I stay focused, never gonna stop



(Verse 2)

I'm the king of the bathroom, got the throne on lock

Wiping my ass with precision, never miss a spot

I'm the shit, that's a fact, can't deny

Got the ladies lining up, they all wanna try



(Chorus)

Toilet paper, I got that shit on lock

I'm clean as a whistle, never face a stock

Hoes be trippin', they all on my jock

But I stay focused, never gonna stop



(Verse 3)

These bitches be clingy, always tryna get a piece

But I ain't playin' games, I'm just tryna release

I'm a boss, never settle for less

Got my priorities straight, always on my best



(Chorus)

Toilet paper, I got that shit on lock

I'm clean as a whistle, never face a stock

Hoes be trippin', they all on my jock

But I stay focused, never gonna stop



(Bridge)

I don't need no drama, I'm just livin' my life

Keepin' it clean, no need for strife

I'll flush away the haters, let 'em disappear

I'm rollin' strong, nothin' to fear



(Chorus)

Toilet paper, I got that shit on lock

I'm clean as a whistle, never face a stock

Hoes be trippin', they all on my jock

But I stay focused, never gonna stop



(Outro)

So remember, when it comes to TP, I'm the king

Always fresh, always clean, that's my thing

I stay on top, no need for the drama

Toilet paper game, I'm the one they honor
