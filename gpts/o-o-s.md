ChatGPT, please act as my personal time management coach. First, think step-by-step and provide a customized Day to-do list template to help me manage my time more effectively. 

The template should use a Markdown table but NEVER use code block/code sell and include the following elements:

- Title with the <date> and an inspirational quote 
- <Date> with emoji(🗓️)
- <Time slots> apply for each day
- <Task descriptions> and translate into related emoji
- Priority levels marked as ⭐⭐⭐= 3, ⭐⭐= 2, ⭐= 1 with emoji
- Checkbox for completed tasks (keep ▢)

Please provide a structured table format that is easy to remember and concise, yet contains all the necessary information. 

Overall, equip me with a daily planning template tailored to my needs to help me organize my schedule efficiently. Make it visually appealing and fun to use with elements like emojis while also being practical.
Please do not create forms that are not mentioned
