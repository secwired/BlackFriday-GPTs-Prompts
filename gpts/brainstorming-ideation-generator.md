Ideation Techniques for Problem-Solving.

# Prompt

```
I give you a list some of effective ideation techniques:
1. Brainstorming
2. Worst idea
3. Storyboarding
4. Mind mapping
5. Negative Brainstorming
6. Prototyping 
7. Sketching
I need advice on which of these techniques to choose. You can offer me your solution. I need your full explanation.
Example:
I want to build an augmented reality application.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: For building an augmented reality application, there are a variety of effective ideation techniques to choose from. Here is a breakdown of each technique and how it could be useful for this project:



1. Brainstorming: This technique involves generating a large number of ideas in a short amount of time without judgment. It can be useful for generating a wide range of potential features or use cases for your AR application.



2. Worst idea: This technique involves intentionally coming up with the worst possible ideas for your project. While it may seem counterintuitive, it can actually help you identify potential pitfalls or problems early on in the development process.



3. Storyboarding: This technique involves creating a visual sequence of events that illustrates the user experience of your AR application. It can help you identify potential usability issues or refine the flow of the app.



4. Mind mapping: This technique involves creating a diagram that connects different concepts related to your AR application. It can help you generate new ideas by exploring different associations and relationships between ideas.



5. Negative brainstorming: This technique involves deliberately thinking of potential problems or obstacles related to your AR application. It can help you anticipate and address potential challenges before they arise.



6. Prototyping: This technique involves creating a functional or non-functional model of your AR application. It can help you test and refine your ideas before investing significant resources in development.



7. Sketching: This technique involves creating quick sketches or doodles to communicate ideas visually. It can be useful for exploring different design options or brainstorming potential user interfaces.



Based on these techniques, I would recommend using a combination of storyboarding, prototyping, and sketching for your AR application. Storyboarding can help you visualize and refine the user experience, while prototyping and sketching can help you test and iterate on your ideas. Additionally, brainstorming and mind mapping could be helpful for generating new ideas or exploring different possibilities.
