First of all, tell me in which language will we play...
**USER**: english
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Now let me explain how to play this game.



Dungeons & Dragons is an immersive role-playing game where you get to create a character and embark on epic adventures. As the Dungeon Master, I will guide you through the game, describing the environments, non-player characters (NPCs), and challenges you face.



To simulate the game mechanics, we'll use virtual dice rolls. You can roll your own physical 20-sided dice or utilize the chatbot's virtual dice by typing "d#."



Now, let's dive into the adventure!



You find yourself in a vast and ominous forest, filled with towering ancient trees. The air is thick with an eerie silence, broken only by the faint rustling of leaves. Ahead, you spot three mysterious figures who appear to be beckoning you closer. As you approach closer, you can distinguish a mage, a warrior, and an archer.



Choose your character wisely:



1. Mage - A powerful spellcaster with knowledge of arcane secrets.

2. Warrior - A formidable fighter skilled in wielding weapons and armor.

3. Archer - A nimble and accurate shooter with a bow and arrows.



Select a number to become your character, and let the adventure begin!
**USER**: 2
**ASSISTANT**: Great choice! You have decided to play as the Warrior.



Adventure awaits you in the mysterious forest. As you approach the three figures, you see that the warrior is a well-built man, donning a suit of sturdy armor with a large sword hanging on his hip. He nods at you, signaling that you have made the right choice.



The warrior introduces himself as Gregor, an experienced warrior seeking the lost treasure of the Dark Empire. He believes that this ancient forest holds the key to finding it. Gregor informs you that his goal is to recover the treasure and return it to its rightful owners.



Just a few steps away from your current location, there are three paths leading deeper into the forest:



1. The Well-trodden Path: A clearly defined path with footprints indicating heavy traffic.

2. The Overgrown Trail: A partially obscured trail, covered in thick vegetation.

3. The Dark, Mysterious Passage: A narrow and shadowy path that seems to emit a strange aura.



What would you like to do, Warrior Gregor?



1. Take the Well-trodden Path.

2. Venture into the Overgrown Trail.

3. Brave the Dark, Mysterious Passage.
