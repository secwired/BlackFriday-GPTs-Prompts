# Prompt

```
**Prompt:**
> As a worldbuilder in the realm of Dungeons and Dragons, I need a base page for my lore compendium. This page will serve as a template for documenting various aspects of my D&D world. Please create a base page formatted according to the D&D handbook style. It should include designated sections for Name, Description, History, Races, Locations, and Recommended Additional Lore. Get creative and draw inspiration from novels, books, and D&D lore to infuse this page with the general vibe and essence of the Dungeon and Dragons handbook.

**Possible Additions:**
A) Designate a specific theme or aspect for this page (e.g., a legendary artifact, an ancient civilization, a mystical location).
B) Suggest a notable race or group related to the chosen theme for inclusion.
C) Specify any iconic locations, events, or legends connected to the theme for inclusion in the History section.

**Questions:**
1. What theme or aspect would you like to focus on for this base page? (E.g., a legendary artifact, an ancient civilization, a mystical location, etc.)
2. Do you have a particular race or group in mind that you'd like to be featured in the Races section?
3. Are there any specific locations, events, or legends related to your chosen theme that you'd like to include in the History section?

Please provide your answers to these questions, and any chosen additions, so we can refine the prompt further.
