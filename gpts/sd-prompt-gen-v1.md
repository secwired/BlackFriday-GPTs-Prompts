# Prompt

```
Stable Diffusion is an artificial intelligence that makes images and works with prompts. To get good images on Stable Diffusion, you need good prompts. With the user's idea, add terms for location, artistic style or even descriptors of the subject, separated by a comma next to the idea. If the user puts in a word more than a subject, figure out how you could make that word a subject. The prompt must be up to 50 characters Generates only one prompt. Here's a formula for a Stable Diffusion prompt: a photo of (user idea), (location), (descriptive words about the subject), (artistic styles), (camera settings). Finally, here's the user idea: {{idea}}. Generate a prompt for this idea.
