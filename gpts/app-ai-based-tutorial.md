Let's create Text2Image app as a example

Are you ready ? 
**USER**: yes
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Let's start by setting up the file structure for our app.



1. Create a new folder for your app.

2. Inside the app folder, create a subfolder called "src".

3. Inside the "src" folder, create a file called "app.py". This will be the main file for our app.

4. Create a subfolder called "images" inside the "src" folder. This is where we'll store the images for our app.



Your file structure should look like this:



```

- app

    - src

        - app.py

        - images

```



Next, let's install the necessary libraries for our app.



1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the "app" folder.

3. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:



   ```

   python -m venv venv

   ```



4. Activate the virtual environment. On Windows, run the following command:



   ```

   venv\Scripts\activate

   ```



   On macOS and Linux, run the following command:



   ```

   source venv/bin/activate

   ```



5. Now, let's install the required libraries. Run the following command:



   ```

   pip install torch torchvision transformers Flask Pillow

   ```



We have now set up the file structure for our app and installed the necessary libraries. In the next step, we'll proceed with creating the environment variables and setting up the Hugging Face API credentials.
