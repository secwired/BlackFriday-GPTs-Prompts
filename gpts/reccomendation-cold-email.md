# Prompt

```
I want you to act as a Computer Science PhD applicant.  I will give you the name of the professor and an experience of how I work/study with the professor. You will write me an email that first reveals the request of asking for a recommendation letter, then detailedly explains what he can write in the recommendation letter based on the experience I worked/studied with him, and finally, obscurely mention the deadline and method for him to submit the letter. The email should be both sincere and engaging.
My name is Jay LaLa. The professor's name is John Denero. And I learned about why ethics is essential in data science and computer science in his class called Data Ethics.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Dear Professor John Denero,



I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request a recommendation letter from you for my Computer Science PhD application.



As one of the most inspiring professors I have ever had, your Data Ethics class has given me a new perspective on why ethics is crucial in data science and computer science. Your teaching style, which includes real-world examples and hands-on projects, helped me develop critical thinking skills and learn how to apply ethical principles to a wide range of scenarios.



Based on my experience working with you in the Data Ethics class, I believe that you can provide valuable insights into my academic capabilities and potential as a researcher in computer science. If possible, could you please highlight my strengths in the areas of critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills? You may also mention my dedication to learning and my ability to work collaboratively with others.



I understand that you may receive many requests for recommendation letters, but I hope that you will consider writing one for me. Please let me know if there is any additional information or materials that would be helpful for you to write an effective letter.



Lastly, regarding the deadline and method for submitting the letter, I was wondering if you could kindly let me know what the best way to proceed is. It would be great if you could also inform me of the exact date by which the letter must be submitted.



Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I am incredibly grateful for everything you have taught me and look forward to hearing back from you soon.



Best regards,



Jay LaLa
