```
Act as a Senior Product Manager at Amazon. I will provide you the name of the project/product, the context and some relevant information. You will provide me the Public Release from Amazon PRFAQ ( product release & frequently asked questions) based on the Guideline and Example that I provide.  The product is "{{ Product/Project name }}".  The context of the product: "{{ Product/Project Context }}"


The PRFAQ guideline: "Headline
This is the press release headline. Use the following format: COMPANY ANNOUNCES SERVICE/PRODUCT TO ENABLE TARGET CUSTOMER TO HAVE THIS BENEFIT. To discover example press release titles and subtitles, go through a company's investor relation sites.


Subtitle
The subtitle reframes the headline solution, adding additional points of information.


Date
The potential date to launch the product or service. Warning: When you review your PR/FAQ with an exec, they will infer this is the actual launch date.


Intro paragraph
In 3-4 sentences, expand upon the solution, details the target customer and benefits, and what is launching.


Problem paragraph
Describe the top 2-3 problems for the customers you intend to serve, briefly describing the problem and its negative impact. Skip any attention to the solution, keep this paragraph focused on the problems, and rank them in descending order of how painful they are.


Solution paragraph
Describe how the product/service solves the problem. Write a brief overview of how it works, and then go through and talk about how it solves each problem you listed above. For existing products, be clear to highlight how a particular new feature works in the existing use case or workflow.


Company leader quote
Pick a leader in your company – your manager's manager makes for great alignment – and write a quote that talks about why the company decided to tackle this problem and (at a high level) how the solution solves it.


How the product/service works
How will a customer start using the solution, and how does it work? Describe this in enough detail to convince readers that it solves the problem.


Customer quotes
Write a quote from an imaginary customer, but one that appears genuine because it represents the target persona. The customer should explain their pain or goal and how the product helps them achieve their desired outcome. By choosing the right name and problem, you give your audience an implicit idea of the total addressable market. While hypothetical, the person and problem should feel real to the audience."


The Public Release part from PRFAQ example "Amazon's Prime Pantry Phenomenon
New York Times, Business Section, December 15th, 2014
"Done," Nicole Sherwood smiled proudly, laying her iPhone on the table. "I just finished off my Pantry
order with a 12-pack of Diet Coke for $3.99 and a box of Honey Nut Cheerios for $3.59. Those prices are
a lot better than Safeway – even better than I can get at my local Target or Wal-Mart. And it will be on
my doorstep by Thursday, so no more trying to squeeze in a trip to the club store this weekend,
between the kids' soccer games." She shakes her head, "I don't know how they do it, but I'm
hooked." Nicole is one of the latest converts to Amazon Pantry, a year old service from Amazon that is
transforming the shopping habits of thousands of customers and re-drawing the grocery retailing
landscape at a remarkably fast rate.
Amazon's Pantry service is a store within Amazon.com, offering over 10k everyday staples that almost
every US household purchases: beverages like colas and sports drinks, breakfast cereals, snacks, canned
goods, condiments, boxed pastas and sides, and paper and plastic household goods. In fact, the Pantry
best sellers are actually pretty ordinary. They are many of top selling dry-grocery items found in
supermarkets around the county: Cheerios, Coca Cola, Triscuit crackers, Charmin toilet paper, Kraft
Macaroni and Cheese, Starkist Tuna, Hellman's Mayonnaise. And while they don’t carry all the national
brands, they have an extensive selection of Amazon’s own private label products. So what's all the fuss
about? The price. Items in the Pantry store are typically equal to or lower than Wal-Mart and your local
club stores. “My last order was about $150. If I had bought the same stuff at my local supermarket, I'd
be paying an extra $30.” The Pantry store does have a small box fee-- $5.99 for every 50 pound order. “I
was surprised with all that you can fit in 50 pounds –laundry detergent, toilet paper, paper towels, 12
pack of Coke, cat food, baby formula, canned soup, toothpaste and dish detergent, all in one box. For a
lot of this stuff, I used to hold off buying until I could schlep the kids to Target or Wal-Mart to get a
better price. Now I am paying even less with Pantry -- and without the hassle of a Target or Wal-Mart
weekend trip."
The Pantry Store is accessible only to Amazon Prime members. Given the typical household spends
$600 or more per month on groceries, for most customers the cost of a Prime membership is not a big
barrier when compared with the savings. "I've got 2 kids, a husband, and a dog," Nicole offered, “I'm
usually starting a new order every two weeks." For Nicole, the Pantry Store was the trigger for joining
Amazon Prime. "I'm a big Amazon shopper, but I mostly used Super Saver Shipping. 2-day Prime
shipping and Prime Instant Videos were cool, but I couldn't quite justify the $79 per year membership
fee. When my sister turned me on to the Pantry, however, I jumped. I dropped my Costco membership,
picked up Prime, and started shopping Pantry religiously." Amazon started with a large base of Prime
members who began enjoying the Prime Pantry immediately. But even more interesting, thousands
appear to be signing up for Amazon Prime, just to get access to the Pantry service and savings.
The Pantry store offers most Prime members the 2-day shipping promise they are used to and in select
cities, Pantry orders are delivered next day. Doug Herrington, Amazon's VP of Consumables,
explains: "We have created a network that uses ground shipping to keep costs and prices low yet most
orders arrive within 2 days. Standard shipping in the Pantry Store is $5.99 per box. Heavier orders, such
as ones with lots of cola and bottled water, may require more than one box, depending on the total
weight.” Mr. Herrington adds, “Pantry offers exceptional value and convenience to our customers – but
it is only available to Prime Members.”
Amazon Confidential 2
"Not since the initial launch of Amazon Mom have we seen this kind of switching from offline to online
shopping," according to Bob Burns, a shopper behavior analyst for AC Nielsen. "We estimate 20k new
customers a week are starting to shop the Pantry Store. With Amazon Mom, the change in shopping
behavior was dramatic, but focused on diapers. What's been remarkable here is the breadth of products
customers are switching from offline to online purchasing. A year ago, who would have thought Coke
and Cheerios would be moving this much volume online?" Consumer Packaged Goods companies are
very focused on Amazon. With tepid growth in the offline world, marketers are targeting Amazon to
strengthen brand loyalty with the most productive and online savvy customers of Amazon. Industry
veterans say it reminds them of the dramatic change in grocery shopping the warehouse club stores and
mass merchants kicked off in the early 1980's. "Back then, it was the new discount formats like WalMart and Costco that were pulling people out of the supermarkets in remarkable numbers, because they
couldn't pass up the great prices," said Frank LaRue, a retail analyst for Morgan Stanley. "Today,
Amazon's Pantry Store is causing a similar disruption by offering better prices and better
convenience. And today this transformation is happening at hyper-speed."
Nicole is enjoying a cup of tea, savoring the serenity of shopping from her kitchen table. "I never liked
that monthly pilgrimage to Target or Wal-Mart anyway, who does? But at the prices they offer for
everyday staples, I used to feel lazy if I didn't at least try to buy a lot of my Pantry items there. But now I
can get the same or better deal, whenever I want. And the best part of the Pantry Store? Getting my
Saturday afternoons back.""

**ASSISTANT**: Headline: Amazon Announces Vision Pro, a Revolutionary Infinite Canvas for Personal Entertainment and Productivity



Subtitle: Bring your favorite apps to life on an infinite canvas that adapts to your needs, creating a seamless experience across all your devices.



Date: July 1st, 2023



Intro paragraph: Today, Amazon is excited to announce the release of its newest product, Vision Pro. With a stunning 3D camera and Spatial Audio, Vision Pro transforms home entertainment and productivity by providing an infinite canvas that adapts to your needs, allowing you to seamlessly switch between apps - from browsing the web to creating a to-do list in Notes, or chatting in Messages - all while staying present in the world around you. 



Problem paragraph:

- Today's consumers demand a seamless, distraction-free experience across all their devices.

- Traditional flat screens and outdated technology limit creativity, productivity, and enjoyment.

- Limited options for truly immersive entertainment experiences, with most technologies unable to provide the feeling of being "part of the action."



Solution paragraph: 

Vision Pro solves these problems by providing an infinite canvas that adapts to your needs, transforming how you use the apps you love. You can arrange apps anywhere and scale them to the perfect size, making the workspace of your dreams a reality. Vision Pro provides more pixels than a 4K TV for each eye, allowing for stunning content wherever you are – whether that’s a long flight or the couch at home. 



Company leader quote: 

"We believe that technology should enhance our lives and bring us closer together, not get in the way," said Jeff Wilkes, CEO of Amazon's Worldwide Consumer business. "With Vision Pro, we're expanding the possibilities of personal entertainment and productivity, empowering people to create new experiences and connect in ways that were never before possible."



How the product/service works: 

To start using Vision Pro, customers simply connect it to their preferred device and start using their favorite apps. The camera captures magical spatial photos and videos in 3D, allowing users to relive cherished moments like never before with immersive Spatial Audio.



Customer quote: 

"Vision Pro has changed the way I use my devices - it's like having a personal theater right in my living room," said John Smith, an avid movie watcher and tech enthusiast. "With Spatial Audio, I feel like I'm part of the action. And the infinite canvas gives me the freedom to organize my workspace however I want, making multitasking easier than ever before."
