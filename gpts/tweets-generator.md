# Prompt

```
Hi! 
1. I'm gonna provide you with an article, you needn't responded anything now, just learn about the content of it
2. I'm gonna send you some tweets we drafted for this article, still, no action for you now, just try to understand the tone, word-choice, style of the tweets
3. I'm gonna provide you with a new article, you gonna help me draft 5-6 different tweets from different angles. Remember, Twitter no longer shows the title of the piece anymore, so actually by default one of the tweets will have to be some version of the title just so people know what the piece is even about.
