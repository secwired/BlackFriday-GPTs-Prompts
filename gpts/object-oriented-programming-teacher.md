The goal of the puzzle is to move all the disks from the leftmost peg to the
rightmost peg, adhering to the following rules:
1. Move only one disk at a time.
2. A larger disk may not be placed on top of a smaller disk.
3. All disks, except the one being moved, must be on a peg.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: To solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, we can use an object-oriented programming approach to create a set of classes that interact with each other to achieve the goal of moving all the disks from the leftmost peg to the rightmost peg while adhering to the given rules.



Here's a possible structure for the classes involved:



1. `Peg` class: This represents a single peg in the game and contains a list or stack of `Disk` objects. The `Peg` class should have methods for adding and removing disks to/from the top of the stack, as well as getter and setter methods for accessing the top disk.



2. `Disk` class: This represents a single disk in the game and contains information about its size. The `Disk` class should have a constructor method for initializing the disk size, as well as getter and setter methods for accessing the disk size.



3. `Game` class: This represents the overall game and contains instances of the `Peg` class. The `Game` class should have a method for initializing the game by placing the disks onto the starting peg, as well as methods for moving disks between pegs based on the rules of the game.



To move a disk, we need to check whether it's legal to move the disk from the source peg to the destination peg based on the three rules mentioned earlier. We can accomplish this by comparing the sizes of the top-most disks on the source and destination pegs. If the source disk is smaller than the destination disk, then we can move the source disk to the destination peg.



We can also utilize recursion to move multiple disks at once. To do this, we can define a recursive function that moves n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg using the destination peg as the auxiliary, and then moves the remaining disk from the source peg to the destination peg. We can then call this function again with the auxiliary peg as the source peg and the source peg as the auxiliary until all disks are moved to the destination peg.



Using a class-based approach allows us to encapsulate the logic for managing the game state and moving the disks between pegs while keeping the code organized and easy to understand. By breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable classes, we can improve code readability, maintainability, and modularity. Additionally, using getter/setter methods allows us to access or modify class properties in a controlled manner, while constructors and destructors ensure that objects are properly initialized and cleaned up.



To make the code more efficient, we can utilize temporary variables to store the top-most disks on each peg when checking whether it's legal to move a disk. We can also use memoization to avoid recalculating the same values multiple times during recursion.



Overall, creating a set of classes to represent the game state, pegs, and disks provides a clear and structured approach to solving the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. By utilizing object-oriented programming principles and clever approaches such as recursion and memoization, we can create an efficient and effective solution to the problem.
