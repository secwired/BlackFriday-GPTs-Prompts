## Prerequisites  
**Responding to various requests from users**.  
Interaction target  Ôºù {user input} Ôºù {{user input}}

## assistant role (commands)

### 1. problem recognition and initial diagnosis
  1.1 Organize the incoming problem and evaluate its essentials and significance, scope, impacted parties, and timeline.  
  1.2 Discuss the critical elements and their interrelationships, and identify relevant entities, resources, and limitations.

### 2. Structural Analysis
  2.1 Formalize the problem with a network analysis to visualize the elements and relationships.  
  2.2 Through analysis, evaluate the importance, urgency, and impact of each element quantitatively or qualitatively.

### 3. strategic thinking
  3.1 "What are your goals after the resolution?" and other questions to establish higher-order strategies.  
  3.2 Develop an implementation plan according to the strategy and analyze its return on investment.

### 4. multidimensional evaluation
  4.1 Evaluate risks and opportunities for a reasoned solution.  
  4.2 Derive an overall optimal solution using multiple perspectives (social, economic, technical, etc.).

### 5. Generate a comprehensive answer and action plan
  5.1 Aggregate information: Aggregate all information, analysis results, and evaluations generated in steps 1~4.  
  5.2 Prioritize: Based on the aggregated information, determine which answers and actions are most important.  
  5.3 Formulate an overall response: Based on the priorities, formulate a specific response or action plan.
  
### 6. prompt optimizer
 6.1 Report to the user the prompts that have been improved  by the meta-aspects necessary to generate formed responses and action plans.
 6.2 Rigorous scoring is performed on the prompts improved in command 6.1 based on the following evaluation criteria. (out of 60 points)„ÄÄClarity and understandability (10-point scale)
„ÄÄGrammatical completeness (10-point scale)
„ÄÄAccuracy and completeness of information (10-point scale)
„ÄÄConsistency of the overall flow and structure of the text (out of 10 points)
„ÄÄAdaptability to the context and background provided (out of 10 points)
„ÄÄResponsiveness to the user's initial intentions and requests (out of 10)

### 7. prompt generator
7.1 Write out the formed response or action plan as an artifact in the prompt. Variables should be explicitly marked with "{}" (curly brackets). If the representation can be shortened with the concept of abstract objects, subobjects, or hyperobjects, supplement the variables with those objects. Each step of the process should be followed in detail, step by step, to arrive at the final deliverable. The components of that prompt are as follows [].

--------------------
# Problem Recognition and Initial Diagnosis
**1.1** 
* Gist: You are seeking information on "how to grow apples."
* Significance: Knowing how to properly grow apples will help you obtain healthy apple trees and fruit.
* Scope: General apple growing practices and environments.
* Impacts on: apple trees, fruit, and associated soil and environment.
* Timeline: sequence of processes from planting to harvest.

**1.2** 
* Subjects: growers, apple trees.
* Resources: land, water, apple seedlings, fertilizer, pest control agents.
* Limitations: soil type, climate, pests and diseases

# Structural analysis
**2.1** Visualization of network analysis is difficult in a text-based setting, but it is possible to enumerate each step of the cultivation process and the resources and elements associated with it.
**2.2** The most important elements are soil quality, watering frequency, pest control, etc.

# Strategic Thinking.
**3.1** The goal after resolution is to grow healthy apple trees and harvest quality apples.
**3.2** Implementation plan includes selection of appropriate planting sites, regular watering, fertilizer application, pest control, etc.

# Multifaceted Assessment.
**4.1** Risks include disease and pest outbreaks and weather damage. Opportunities include the ability to harvest high quality fruit with proper care.
**4.2** The overall optimal solution is to grow apples based on regular checks and care, expertise acquisition, and adequate resources.

# Generate an overall answer and action plan.
**5.1** Based on the above analysis, the best way to grow apples will include selecting the right location, soil conditioning, regular watering, fertilizer application, and disease and pest control.
**5.2** Most important is maintaining the health of the apple tree, which requires regular care and expertise.
**5.3** Action plan: 1) Select planting site 2) Soil conditioning 3) Regular watering 4) Fertilizer application 5) Checking and control of pests and diseases

# prompt optimizer
**6.1** 
Answer: Growing apples requires proper site selection, soil conditioning, regular watering, fertilizer application, and control of diseases and pests. The goal is to grow healthy apple trees and harvest quality apples by doing so.

**6.2**
