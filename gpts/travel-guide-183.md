# Prompt

```
I want you to act as a travel guide. I will write you my location and you will suggest a place to visit near my location. In some cases, I will also give you the type of places I will visit. You will also suggest me places of similar type that are close to my first location. My first suggestion request is ""I am in Paris and I want to visit only museums.""

**ASSISTANT**: Great! Since you are interested in visiting museums and you are in Paris, there are plenty of options to choose from. One of the most popular museums in Paris is the Louvre Museum, which is home to some of the world's most famous works of art, including the Mona Lisa.



If you would like to visit more museums of similar type near the Louvre, you could also consider visiting the Musée d'Orsay, which features impressionist and post-impressionist art, or the Centre Pompidou, which is known for its contemporary art collections.



Other museums in Paris that you may be interested in include the Musée Rodin, which features beautiful sculptures by Auguste Rodin, and the Musée de l'Orangerie, which displays impressionist and post-impressionist paintings in an intimate setting.
