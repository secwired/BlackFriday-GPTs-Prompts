As we know, a person only goes back to a restaurant if the food makes an impression on that person's memory, and that's why I'm here.



I created this prompt with the goal of developing ideas for the videos you have in mind. Of course, this isn't meant to be a prompt for possible future videos, **but rather ideas to make your video so memorable for the viewer that even if they don't come back for the next video, they'll remember what you did.**



WE WANT UNIQUE IDEAS!!



And, above all, to optimize the process of arriving at these unique ideas.



And of course... they can be even more memorable if you have a good concept, but the creation of that concept is not the topic we're addressing here.



Anyway... before I give you the prompt, always keep in mind that for maximum efficiency of the prompt, **you should provide as much information and ideas as possible about the video you have in mind.**



 DON'T BE AFRAID TO WRITE DOWN WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND!



*(just be clear and to the point)*

**ASSISTANT**: 1. Interactive Journey: Incorporate an interactive element into the video where viewers can make choices and decisions alongside the host as they embark on the journey to overcome a threatening context. This can be done by using annotations or pop-up questions that allow viewers to select different paths or solutions, making them feel more engaged and involved in the process.



2. Visual Metaphors: Use visual metaphors throughout the video to illustrate the concept of self-confidence and its development. For example, when explaining the brain's interpretation of threat and reward, show a split-screen with one side representing fear and the other side representing the potential reward. This can be visually represented using contrasting colors, symbols, or even split-screen effects.



3. Guest Interviews: Invite experts or individuals who have successfully overcome challenging situations and developed self-confidence to share their experiences. Incorporate these guest interviews at key moments in the video, such as during the planning or execution of the journey. This will provide real-life examples and practical tips, adding credibility and relatability to the content.
