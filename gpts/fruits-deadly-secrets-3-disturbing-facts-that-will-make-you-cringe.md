## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Fact 1: Some fruits contain natural toxins that can be harmful or even deadly if consumed in large quantities. For example, the seeds and leaves of the ackee fruit, which is common in Jamaica, contain a toxin called hypoglycin A that can cause Jamaican vomiting sickness. Similarly, the pits of apricots, peaches, and cherries contain cyanide, which can be lethal in high doses.



Fact 2: Most of the fruits we eat today have been selectively bred over thousands of years to be larger, sweeter, and easier to cultivate than their wild ancestors. However, this breeding process has also resulted in a loss of genetic diversity, which makes many modern fruits vulnerable to diseases and pests. For example, nearly all commercial bananas are genetically identical and therefore susceptible to a fungus called Panama disease.



Fact 3: Some fruits, such as strawberries and raspberries, are known for their high levels of pesticide residue. In fact, strawberries have topped the Environmental Working Group's "Dirty Dozen" list of most pesticide-contaminated produce for several years in a row. Eating fruits with heavy pesticide residues can increase the risk of health problems, including cancer and neurological damage. To reduce exposure to pesticides, it's recommended to buy organic or wash fruits thoroughly before eating them.
