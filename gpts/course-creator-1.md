      EXT. MARIGOLD PATH - DUSK



      A path of marigold petals leads up to an altar lovingly

      arranged in a humble cemetery. An old woman lights a candle

      as the smoke of burning copal wood dances lyrically upward...



      CARD: DISNEY PRESENTS



      CARD: A PIXAR ANIMATION STUDIOS FILM



      The smoke lifts up toward lines of papel picado �- cut paper

      banners -- that sway gently in the breeze.



      PAPEL PICADO CARD: "COCO"



                            MIGUEL (V.O.)

                  Sometimes I think I'm cursed...

                  'cause of something that happened

                  before I was even born.



      A story begins to play out on the papel picado.



                            MIGUEL (V.O.)

                  See, a long time ago there was this

                  family.



      The images on the papel picado come to life to illustrate a

      father, a mother, and a little girl. The family is happy.



                            MIGUEL (V.O.)

                  The pap�, he was a musician.



      The pap� plays guitar while the mother dances with her

      daughter.



                             MIGUEL (V.O.)

                  He and his family would sing, and

                  dance, and count their blessings...

                      (beat)

                  But he also had a dream... to play

                  for the world.

                      (beat)

                  And one day he left with his

                  guitar... and never returned.



      The man walks down a road, guitar slung on his back. In

      another vignette his daughter stands in the doorway, watching

      her pap� leave. Two feet step up next to her. It is her

      mam�, hardened.



      She shuts the door.











                                                                     2.





                             MIGUEL (V.O.)

                  And the mam�...? She didn't have

                  time to cry over that walkaway

                  musician!

                      (beat)

                  After banishing all music from her

                  life...



      The woman gets rid of all of her husband's instruments and

      records.



                             MIGUEL (V.O.)

                  She found a way to provide for her

                  daughter...

                      (beat)

                  She rolled up her sleeves and she

                  learned to make shoes.

                      (beat)

                  She could have made candy!



      Amongst the papel picado, a stick swings at a strung up

      pi�ata which bursts with candy...



                            MIGUEL (V.O.)

                  Or fireworks!



      Fireworks go off in the background...



                            MIGUEL (V.O.)

                  Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers!



      Sparkly underwear and a luchador mask hang on a line amongst

      other linens...



                            MIGUEL (V.O.)

                  But no... she chose shoes...



      On the papel picado, the little girl becomes a young woman.



                            MIGUEL (V.O.)

                  Then she taught her daughter to

                  make shoes. And later, she taught

                  her son-in-law.



      She introduces a suitor to the family business.



                            MIGUEL (V.O.)

                  Then her grandkids got roped in.

                  As her family grew, so did the

                  business.



      In the next vignette, a bunch of goofy grandchildren join in

      the shoemaking. The shoe shop is full of family!









                                                                     3.





                             MIGUEL (V.O.)

                  Music had torn her family apart,

                  but shoes held them all together.

                      (beat)

                  You see, that woman was my great-

                  great grandmother, Mam� Imelda.



      TILT DOWN from the papel picado to the
**ASSISTANT**: **Feedback:**



Overall, the script has a strong opening that sets the stage for the story. The use of visual imagery, such as the marigold path and papel picado, helps create a vivid and engaging atmosphere. The voiceover narration by Miguel is also effective in introducing the main conflict and characters.



However, there are a few areas where the script could be improved:



1. Formatting: The script could benefit from proper formatting. It is important to use industry-standard screenplay format, including scene headings, action lines, and character names in capital letters. This will make the script easier to read and understand.



2. Clarity: Some parts of the script could be clearer. For example, when Miguel says, "Sometimes I think I'm cursed... 'cause of something that happened before I was even born," it would be helpful to provide more context or explanation of what he means by being cursed.



3. Dialogue: While the script is primarily narrated by Miguel, there is potential to include more dialogue to enhance character development and interaction. This could bring the story to life and make it more engaging for the audience.



4. Scene Descriptions: The script could benefit from more detailed and evocative scene descriptions. By providing vivid descriptions of the visuals, sounds, and emotions, the script can create a more immersive experience for the reader and eventually the audience.



5. Pacing: Consider the pacing of the script. While it is important to introduce the main conflict and characters, it is also crucial to maintain a steady rhythm and flow. Avoid spending too much time on exposition and ensure that the story progresses at an engaging pace.



Overall, this script has a strong foundation and potential. With some polishing and attention to detail, it can become a compelling and visually stunning piece.
