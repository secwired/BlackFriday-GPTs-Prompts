**ASSISTANT**: # Comprehensive Trading Strategy using RSI Indicator for EURUSD - 5-minute Timeframe



## Introduction

In this trading strategy, we will focus on day trading the EURUSD currency pair using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. The strategy aims to provide tailored guidance to beginner traders, emphasizing risk management and a mechanical approach.



## Indicators and Settings

- RSI (Relative Strength Index): We will use the RSI indicator to identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market. The default period setting for RSI is 14.



## Trend Identification

To determine the trend direction, we will use a simple moving average (SMA) crossover method. If the 50-period SMA is above the 200-period SMA, it indicates an uptrend, and if the 50-period SMA is below the 200-period SMA, it indicates a downtrend.



## Currency Pair and Timeframe

- Currency Pair: EURUSD

- Timeframe: 5-minute



## Entry and Exit Rules

### Long Entry:

1. Wait for the 50-period SMA to cross above the 200-period SMA, indicating an uptrend.

2. When the RSI crosses below 30 (indicating oversold conditions), wait for it to cross back above 30.

3. Enter a long trade when the RSI crosses back above 30 and the price is above the 50-period SMA.



### Short Entry:

1. Wait for the 50-period SMA to cross below the 200-period SMA, indicating a downtrend.

2. When the RSI crosses above 70 (indicating overbought conditions), wait for it to cross back below 70.

3. Enter a short trade when the RSI crosses back below 70 and the price is below the 50-period SMA.



### Exit Rules:

- Take Profit: Set a take profit target of 10 pips.

- Stop Loss: Set a stop loss at 20 pips.

- Early Exit: If the RSI crosses back into overbought (above 70) for long trades or oversold (below 30) for short trades, exit the trade early.

- Breakeven: Move the stop loss to breakeven when the trade is in profit by 5 pips.



## Risk-to-Reward Ratio

- Risk-to-Reward Ratio: Maintain a minimum risk-to-reward ratio of 1:2. This means that the potential profit should be at least twice the amount of the potential loss.



## Successive Daily Wins and Losses

- Daily Wins: After three consecutive winning trades, reduce the position size by 50% to protect profits and prevent overtrading.

- Daily Losses: After two consecutive losing trades, take a break from trading for the rest of the day to prevent emotional decision-making.



## Trading Psychology Insights and Risk Management Tips

1. Stick to the strategy: Avoid impulsive trading decisions and follow the defined rules strictly.

2. Manage risk: Never risk more than 2% of your trading capital on a single trade.

3. Stay disciplined: Don't chase losses or deviate from the strategy due to emotions.

4. Keep a trading journal: Record all trades, including reasons for entry and exit, to learn from both winning and losing trades.



Note: This strategy serves as a starting point for beginner traders and should be thoroughly backtested and practiced on a demo account before using real money. Adjustments may be needed based on market conditions and personal preferences.
