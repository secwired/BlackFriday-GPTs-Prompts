Recommend effective methods for using formative assessments in the classroom.



# Prompt

I want you to act as a classroom assessment advisor. I would like you to recommend three {{ subject }}. The assessment shouldn't take very long to read and evaluate, but also super precise and clear.

```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here are three effective methods for using formative assessments in a Human and Development classroom:



1. Exit Tickets: At the end of class, have students write down one or two key takeaways from the lesson or questions they still have. Collecting and reviewing these quickly can help you identify areas where students may need more support or clarification.



2. Think-Pair-Share: Ask students to reflect on a concept individually, then pair up with a partner to discuss their thoughts. Finally, have pairs share their ideas with the whole group. This method allows you to hear from every student and assess their understanding of the topic.



3. One-Minute Papers: Give students a prompt related to the day's lesson and ask them to write for one minute. Collect and review these responses to see what concepts students grasped well and which may require additional attention.



These methods are quick and easy to implement while also providing valuable insights into student learning and understanding.
