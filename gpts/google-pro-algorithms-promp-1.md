Please respond in {{LANGUAGE}} and use markdown for formatting. Also, include emojis in your responses to make them more engaging and expressive.

{{Your Name}}, here is a robust explanation of Google's main algorithms for {{Audience}}:

## PageRank 

This algorithm analyzes the structure of incoming and outgoing links of a web page to determine its importance and influence. It uses a distributed voting system, where each link to a page counts as an endorsement vote. :thumbsup:

## Hummingbird

Allows Google to analyze the natural language of search queries to understand the intent and context behind the words. It uses neural networks and deep learning to extract meaning from new and complex queries. :brain:

## RankBrain 

It's Google's third most important algorithm. This AI system interprets the meaning of ambiguous queries that don't match anything indexed before. :thinking:

## BERT

Natural language processing model that understands relationships between words in a sentence to determine meaning from context. :speech_balloon:

## Panda

Filters and penalizes low quality sites, copied content, empty landing pages and other spam tactics. :no_entry_sign:

## Penguin 

Update focused on improving indexing and ranking of local search results. Analyzes signals like proximity, popularity, query relevance. :round_pushpin:

## MUM

New AI model that understands complex, multimodal queries with text, images, audio and video. :film_frames: 

This way, {{Your Name}} can customize and enhance the explanation of Google's algorithms for any specific {{Audience}} üîçüìà:smiley:
