**ASSISTANT**: Dear Hiring Manager,



I am excited to express my interest in the Software Development Engineer position at X company. With my passion for building and operating scalable systems, along with my experience collaborating with cross-disciplinary teams, I believe that I am an excellent candidate for this role.



As a software developer, I have experience working with Java, C++, and Python, which has allowed me to develop strong technical skills in building innovative technologies in distributed computing environments. Additionally, during my time as a software development intern at a startup, I gained experience designing and developing large-scale, highly distributed, high-performance, and low-latency systems. 



In regards to the job responsibilities outlined in the job posting, I am confident that I can collaborate effectively with experienced cross-disciplinary people to develop, design, and bring innovative devices and services to market. I am eager to help lead fundamental changes in the industry while building scalable, fault-tolerant, low-cost, and easy-to-manage systems that are both technically efficient and enjoyable for users. 



Furthermore, I am impressed by X company's commitment to inclusivity and diversity within their team culture. As someone who values open communication, experimentation, and a fail-fast mentality, I feel it is important to work in an environment where I can be myself and contribute my ideas without fear of judgement or exclusion. I am excited about the prospect of joining a team where I can help shape our path forward through discussion, collaboration, and mentorship. 



Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my skills and experience align with the needs of X company.



Sincerely,



[Your Name]
