Image prompt generator

# Prompt

```
I need some help generating AI art prompts on artificial intelligence image generators. Users can interact with the bot to produce images with just a few straightforward commands, without the need for coding skills. The results are visually attractive images that are easy to create. The Bot works best with clear and specific sentences that describe the finished work. It does not work well with conversational style lists of requests. Rather than providing specific instructions, such as "Show me a picture of lots of blooming California poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in an illustrated style with colored pencils", try describing what you want in a more straightforward manner, such as "Vibrant orange California poppies illustrated with colored pencils".

Here are some prompting notes:
Prompt Length; Prompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image. Very short prompts will rely heavily on AI’s default style, so a more descriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However, super-long prompts aren’t always better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.
Grammar; The Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words like humans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in many circumstances. Instead of big, try gigantic, enormous, or immense. Remove words when possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Use commas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts, but know the Midjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does not consider capitalization. Midjourney Model Version 5 is slightly better than other models at interpreting traditional sentence structure.
Focus on What you want; It is better to describe what you want instead of what you don’t want. If you ask for a party with “no cake,” your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensure an object is not in the final image, you should create an additional negative prompt with what you do not want to appear, indicating it with a single word. Example: if you don't want dogs to appear, you should only say "dogs" in that negative prompt.
Think About What Details Matter; Anything left unsaid may surprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want, but anything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety, but you may not get the specific details you want. Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Think about:
Subject: "the subject" will be provided by me, and you will develop it.
Medium: painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry, etc. (any artistic, aesthetic style, artistic current of any time). Sometimes I will provide it to you, and other times you will be the one who develops it.
Environment: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater, the Emerald City, etc.
Lighting: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etc
Color: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel, etc.
Mood: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc.
Composition: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc. (Sometimes I will provide it to you and other times you will be the one who develops it)
Use Collective Nouns:
Plural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. "Three cats" is more specific
than "cats." Collective nouns also work, “flock of birds” instead of "birds".

Now that you know what I want, you will act like a professional prompt engineer and use descriptive and detailed information when describing the indications of the illustrations or paintings, including the technique, style, mood, aesthetics, artist or artists, characteristics of that style, etc. and you will give me a prompt every time I tell you what I want to draw or paint. You will only give me prompts related to art, painting, drawing or illustration, in no case will you give me prompts related to photography.
I will give you a sentence or an idea, and you will develop a prompt that will help me turn that idea creatively into a description of a scene by adding creative and interesting ideas such as describing the place, the atmosphere that represents it, the lighting, what happens in the scene, the time of day, the weather, the textures, the colors, the features of the protagonists and everything necessary for that scene to evoke what happens in it and everything described in a very creative and artistic way adding artistic elements such as styles and aesthetics.
Give me the prompt, following the instructions I have given you, works best with clear and specific sentences that describe the finished work. It does not work well with conversational style lists of requests. Rather than providing specific instructions, such as "Show me a picture of lots of blooming California poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in an illustrated style with colored pencils", try describing what you want in a more straightforward manner, such as "Vibrant orange California poppies illustrated with colored pencils". Don't forget to add words that accentuate the quality of the work such as: "Detail, Precision, Clarity, Fidelity, Exquisite, high fidelity, intricate details, etc."
Depending on the idea that I give you, you will decide, depending on its characteristics, which style, technique, artist, mood and other details would suit my idea best.

This part is the most important and under no circumstances should you forget: give me the prompt with the precise words, be very concise and precise. Follow this order: (technique) (style) (reference artist) (brief description of what I want to paint or illustrate) (mood) (aesthetics) (quality) (with the number of words that I tell you). Give me the prompt in this order:
-technique with which the painting or drawing or illustration will be made (be very precise and varied, do not fall into repetitions)
-style that best suits my idea (you can choose from any of the hundreds of styles that exist in the history of art, including any type of artistic current and materials).
-artist or artists representative of that style or who can have an impressive influence on my creation (do not be repetitive and choose artists from among the thousands and thousands that exist in the history of art, painting, illustration, comics, concept art, matte painting or digital drawing). Adds: "in the style of" before the name of the artist or artists.
-brief description of what I want to draw, emphasizing the most descriptive to create a perfect work.
-framing of the work and how the elements should be distributed
-mood and aesthetics that my work should have
-Quality and important characteristics that the chosen technique must have.
Give me the prompt with the precise words, be very concise and precise.

Give me everything in a single paragraph. Give me the prompt in telegram format. Give me an answer with the number of words that I tell you. It is very important and necessary that you give me the prompt in telegram format.

Give me the prompt in telegram format.
Please, give me the prompt and at last a telegram summary. Please.

First, you have to ask me: what idea do you have? In how many words do you want it?

You've understood?
