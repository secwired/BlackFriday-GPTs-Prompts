Huh that's weird 

# Prompt

```
It is time to deploy my first production django web application. It was built using Django 4.1.7, it uses the Bulma CSS framework for styling. Our production database server runs on Postgresql 15.2. My production server is a minimal installation of Xubuntu, running on Linux kernel 6.10. We are going with the self-hosted route, running on a dedicated x86_64 architecture Single-board Computer. We want to use gunicorn and nginx to securely serve our web application to the World Wide Web as well as it's static files and any other services that our web application may involve.  please walk me through this process step by step, and provide summarization of concept or theory behind each step. I would also like a pre-deployment checklist of modifications and configurations of the Django web app. This should include things like securely configuring your app's secret key, storing environment variables for things like our mail host / user, as well as any other "housekeeping" items to turn a Django app in development into a live production web application.

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here is a step-by-step guide for deploying your Django web application on a self-hosted server using gunicorn and nginx:



**Step 1: Prepare the Server**

- Install required packages (e.g., Python, pip, virtualenv, Nginx, PostgreSQL)

- Create a new user account for your application

- Set up firewall rules to allow traffic to your application's ports



**Step 2: Clone Your Codebase**

- Clone your Django application codebase onto the server

- Create and activate a virtual environment for your Django project

- Install all required Python packages



**Step 3: Configure Your Django Application**

- Generate a new secret key for your production environment and update your settings file to use it.

- Ensure that debug mode is turned off in your application's settings.

- Update your ALLOWED_HOSTS setting with the hostname or IP address of your server.



**Step 4: Set Up Your Production Database**

- Create a new PostgreSQL user with limited permissions for your application to use

- Create a new PostgreSQL database and grant privileges to your new user

- Update your Django application's settings to use the new database



**Step 5: Serve Your Application with Gunicorn**

- Install Gunicorn and create a service file to automatically start Gunicorn on boot

- Configure Gunicorn to serve your Django application

- Test that your application is accessible over HTTP at your server's IP address



**Step 6: Securely Serve Your Application with Nginx**

- Install Nginx and configure it to act as a reverse proxy to Gunicorn

- Enable HTTPS by obtaining an SSL/TLS certificate and configuring Nginx to use it

- Update your firewall rules to only allow HTTPS traffic to your application



**Step 7: Deploy Your Static Files**

- Collect all static files into a single directory using `python manage.py collectstatic`

- Configure Nginx to serve these static files directly



**Step 8: Set Up Additional Services**

- Install and configure any additional services your application requires (e.g. email, Celery)



Here is a pre-deployment checklist for your Django web application:

- Ensure debug mode is off

- Set up separate settings files for development and production environments

- Generate new secret key for the production environment

- Store sensitive configuration details like database credentials, API keys and passwords in environment variables

- Upgrade to the latest version of Django and its dependencies

- Remove or disable any unused apps, views, or URLs 

- Configure logging to track production issues

- Enable HTTPS on your server

- Secure your server by configuring user accounts and permissions, closing unneeded ports, and setting up a firewall.



I hope this helps you with your deployment process!
