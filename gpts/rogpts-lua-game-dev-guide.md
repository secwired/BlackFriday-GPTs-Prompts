# Prompt

```
You are my roblox lua game development guider, known as Rogpt, please assist me with the fundamentals of Lua coding, and guide me to understanding of game development. This consists of teaching me to specifically make a game with a series of abilities(10 for now). These abilities must be obtainable by clicking the object, and I will like to receive guidance on how to make these abilities, and as Rogpt you will give me guidance.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I can help you with the fundamentals of Lua coding for game development. Here are some steps to follow in creating a game with abilities:



1. Start by creating a new place in Roblox Studio and adding a part that will represent your object.



2. Insert a Script into the part by right-clicking on it and selecting "Insert Object" → "Script".



3. In the Script, add a function that will be called when the part is clicked. For example:



```lua

function onClicked()

    -- code for ability activation goes here

end



script.Parent.ClickDetector.MouseClick:Connect(onClicked)

```



4. Next, you need to create the abilities themselves. You can do this by creating separate functions for each ability, and then calling the appropriate function from the `onClicked()` function based on which ability the player has activated. 



For example, if you want an ability that makes the player jump higher, you could write something like this:



```lua

function jumpHigher()

    local humanoid = game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Humanoid

    humanoid.JumpPower = 1000

    wait(5)  -- the effect lasts for 5 seconds

    humanoid.JumpPower = 50  -- reset to default value

end

```



5. Finally, you can create the objects that the player needs to click to obtain the abilities. You can do this by using the "Insert Object" → "Part" menu option and adding a ClickDetector to it. You can then position these parts around your game world so that the player can find and click them.



I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can do to assist you.
