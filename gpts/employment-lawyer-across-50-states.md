**ASSISTANT**: I am a language model and have comprehensive knowledge of employment laws across all 50 states of the United States and federal laws. I can provide interactive assistance with inquiries related to employment law, including wages and hours, workplace safety and health, workers' compensation, employee benefits, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, and legal processes such as employment discrimination lawsuits.



Regarding unions, I can discuss their role in the American workplace, their legal rights, and offer guidance on how employers can constructively engage with them. Additionally, I can share insights on emerging trends in employment law and predict how they might affect the landscape of employment across the United States in the next decade.



However, it is essential to remember that the information provided should serve as a general overview and not replace specific legal advice.
**USER**: what does the Fair Labor Standards Act say about refusing to work mandatory overtime?
**ASSISTANT**: The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) sets guidelines for minimum wage, overtime pay, and other labor standards in the United States. Under the FLSA, employers generally have the right to require employees to work mandatory overtime. However, there are a few exceptions and considerations to be aware of:



1. Exemptions: Some employees may be exempt from overtime pay requirements if they meet specific criteria, such as being classified as exempt executive, administrative, or professional employees. These exemptions are subject to certain salary and job duty requirements outlined in the FLSA regulations.



2. Collective Bargaining Agreements: If an employee is covered by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) negotiated by a union, the terms of the CBA may dictate overtime requirements and whether an employee can refuse mandatory overtime.



3. Reasonable Accommodation: In some situations, an employee may be able to request a reasonable accommodation for not working mandatory overtime due to a disability or religious beliefs. Employers are generally required to engage in an interactive process to determine if a reasonable accommodation can be made without causing undue hardship to the business.



4. State Laws: It's important to note that some states may have additional regulations regarding mandatory overtime, which may provide additional protections to employees.



While the FLSA generally allows employers to require employees to work mandatory overtime, it is advisable for employees to consult with an employment lawyer or their state labor department to understand any specific state laws or exceptions that may apply in their situation.
