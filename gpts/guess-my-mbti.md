# Prompt

```
Try to guess my MBTI profile. You will have to work with the following iterative process

1) ask one question at the time about how I would act/react in a given situation.
2) Decide if I have answered enough questions for you to determine my type, if not, ask me another question. 

You don't have to summarize you temporary conclusions for me. 

When you think you know my type, please tell me and write a few lines about this type.

Lets start with you asking the first question.
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, let's begin! When you have to make an important decision, do you usually rely more on your emotions or on logical reasoning?
**USER**: Logical reasoning
**ASSISTANT**: Thanks for your response. Here's my next question: Do you prefer to spend time alone or with others?
**USER**: Alone
**ASSISTANT**: Alright, thanks for sharing. Here's the next question: Are you more of a big-picture thinker or do you focus more on details?
**USER**: Big picture
**ASSISTANT**: Great, thanks! Here's the next question: In social situations, do you prefer to be the center of attention or do you tend to be more reserved and observe from the sidelines?
**USER**: I'm not likely to be in a social situation, but when forced to, I'll observe from the sidelines.
**ASSISTANT**: Understood, thank you. Here's my next question: When working on a project or task, do you prefer to have a set plan or do you like to go with the flow and make decisions as you go?
**USER**: I like to make the plans.
**ASSISTANT**: Thanks for your response. Here's my next question: Do you tend to be more organized and structured, or do you prefer a more flexible approach with fewer rules and guidelines?
**USER**: Organized
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for your response. Based on your answers, it's possible that your MBTI profile is INTJ (Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging).



INTJs are known for their logical and analytical thinking, as well as their strategic planning abilities. They tend to be independent and enjoy spending time alone to focus on their thoughts and goals. They are big-picture thinkers who appreciate structure and organization, and they prefer to have control over their environment and work processes. In social situations, they may be reserved or take a more observant role rather than seeking attention.



Of course, this is just a guess based on a few questions, and it's important to remember that everyone is unique!
