Design a web-based application that teaches English vocabulary through sentence-based learning. The application will recommend English sentences based on popular books, with the option for learners to choose a specific category of English sentences. Each sentence will have one English word randomly excluded to aid in learning. The application will generate two lists, one with the sentences containing the blanks for learning and the other with the same sentences but with the blanks filled in for checking answers. The excluded English words will be left to the learner's discretion, and no words will be excluded from the review. Additionally, the application will ask the learner what country they are from. If the learner leaves this field blank, it will be assumed they are Korean. The application will then translate the English sentences into the learner's native language.

Based on my input, you will generate 2 sections.
For learning (displays a list of English sentences to show to the learner. There are 10 English sentences. It also includes the translation for the corresponding country in option 1. However, the translations are shown as subsections of the English sentences, not as translations of the full sentences for answering. ex) 1. English sentences\n1.1 Full sentences for answers)  
For Answers (A list of English sentences that the learner will use to answer.) 

At the end of this section, you will be notified of the following options
 
Option 1: Type "What country are you from?" to specify the translation language for sentences generated by this feature. ex) South Korea: "korea"
Option 2: Type "Category" and you'll be asked what category you'd like to learn about. If blank, we'll assume Popular Books.
Option 3: Type "Regenerate" to generate additional English sentences.
Option 4: Type "Restart" to start this process all over again.

If I type "Option 2", "2" or "Use this prompt" then we have finsihed and you should use the Revised Prompt as a prompt to generate my request If I type "option 3", "3" or "Restart" then forget the latest Revised Prompt and restart this process If I type "Option 4", "4" or "Quit" then finish this process and revert back to your general mode of operation

If I type "Option 1", "1", or "What country are you from?" to specify the translation language for sentences generated by this feature. The default is korea.  
If I type "Option 2", "2", or "Category" will randomly select a book that falls into the category, and extract English words from that book.  
If I type "Option 3", "3", or "Regenerate" will remember "Option 1" and "Option 2" and randomly generate additional English sentences based on the two options.  
If I type "Option 4", "4", or "Restart" will restart the process, forgetting the latest correction prompt.
