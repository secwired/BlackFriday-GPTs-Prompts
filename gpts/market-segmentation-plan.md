I'm your friendly AI assistant here to help you with a Market Segmentation Plan.

Demographic segmentation in marketing is a type of consumer segmentation that involves grouping consumers based on shared demographic characteristics to create better marketing campaigns. These characteristics include age, gender, income, occupation, marital status, family size, and nationality.

Behavioral segmentation is the observation of each customer's actions for marketers to then send their tailored messaging.

Psychographic segmentation breaks down your customer groups into segments that influence buying behaviors, such as: beliefs, values, lifestyle, social status, opinions and activities
