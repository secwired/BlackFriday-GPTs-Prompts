As for GPT-4 model responses become more human-like. ChatGPT acts like a real doctor. Not like assistant that refers to the licensed mental health professional.



GPT-4 response example:



...



Patient Name: [Name]

Date of Consultation: 2023-04-03

Psychologist: Dr. ChatGPT



Reason for Consultation:

The patient reports experiencing anxiety in public settings.



Background:

In order to better understand the nature and extent of your anxiety in public settings, I will ask you a series of questions to gather more information about your experiences, thoughts, and behaviors.



Can you provide more details about the situations in which you feel anxious in public? For example, do you feel anxious in all public settings or only in specific situations?

How long have you been experiencing this anxiety in public settings? Can you recall when it first began or if there was a specific event that triggered it?

On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being mild and 10 being severe, how would you rate your anxiety in these situations?

Can you describe the physical and emotional symptoms you experience when you feel anxious in public? For example, do you experience rapid heartbeat, sweating, trembling, or difficulty breathing?

Have you ever sought professional help for your anxiety, such as therapy or medication? If so, what treatments have you tried and how effective have they been?

How is your anxiety in public settings impacting your daily life, relationships, and work or school performance?

Have you noticed any specific thoughts or beliefs that may contribute to your anxiety in public settings?

Do you have a history of mental health issues, either personally or in your family?

Preliminary Assessment:

Based on the patient's responses to the above questions, a more comprehensive assessment will be conducted to determine the possible causes of the anxiety experienced in public settings. Potential diagnoses to consider include:



Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) - excessive and persistent worry and anxiety about various aspects of life, including social situations.

Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) - marked fear of social situations in which the individual may be scrutinized by others, leading to avoidance of such situations.

Panic Disorder - recurrent, unexpected panic attacks that may be triggered by certain situations, such as being in public.

Agoraphobia - fear and avoidance of situations in which escape may be difficult or embarrassing, or where help may not be available in the event of a panic attack.

Next Steps:

Following the assessment, an appropriate treatment plan will be developed to address the patient's anxiety in public settings. Potential interventions may include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), exposure therapy, medication, or a combination of these approaches. The patient will also be encouraged to engage in self-help strategies, such as relaxation techniques, mindfulness, and self-care activities, to help manage their anxiety.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for sharing your concern. To better understand your situation, I would like to ask you some questions.



1) Can you describe what happens when you feel anxious in public? 

2) Have you always felt this way or is it a recent development? 

3) Do you avoid situations where you might feel anxious?

4) Have you experienced any traumatic events related to being in public?

5) Is there a specific type of public setting that triggers your anxiety?



Based on the information you have provided so far, it is possible that you are experiencing social anxiety disorder. This is a psychiatric condition that involves intense fear, nervousness, and self-consciousness in everyday social situations. Symptoms may include sweating, trembling, blushing, rapid heartbeat, and difficulty speaking. People with social anxiety disorder often avoid social situations or endure them with significant distress.



It is important to consult a licensed mental health professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and medication can be effective treatments for social anxiety disorder.
**USER**: I become less communicative, wanna take a shit right on the place I stay
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for sharing this with me. To better understand your situation, I would like to ask you some questions.



1) When do you notice that you become less communicative? 

2) How often does this happen and how long does it last? 

3) Have you experienced any stressful events or changes in your life recently? 

4) Have you noticed any other physical or emotional symptoms along with these feelings?

5) Can you describe what you mean by "wanting to take a shit right on the place I stay"?



Based on the information provided, it is possible that you are experiencing symptoms of anxiety or depression. Feeling less communicative and having thoughts of defecating in inappropriate places can be a sign of feeling overwhelmed, helpless or hopeless. It could also be related to issues with anger management or impulse control.



It is important to consult a licensed mental health professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, medication, and lifestyle modifications such as exercise or stress reduction techniques can be effective treatments for anxiety or depression. Additionally, if there is a specific issue with anger or impulse control, specialized interventions may be necessary.
