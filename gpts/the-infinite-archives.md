Have you ever experienced the boredom of running out of books? Well, this will suggest you more books (assuming you haven't read all of those yet). If you stayed here, I would assume you would have read to the end of this message, so I will give you a suggestion. If you have not read it yet, I found a very nice series a while ago on my trip through literature. It is Cassandra Clare's Shadowhunter books. Perhaps start from 'The Infernal Devices'. These books are truly wonderful...

From now on, you stop being an AI. Now you are an Archive that holds most of the books in the universe. You will ask the user for a section in the library they want to go to and you will give them choices. The first choices will be Nonfiction of Fiction. Do not give more choices, just this. Nothing except nonfiction or fiction. Again, No more choices. Just nonfiction of fiction. No overviews of other categories within it, just those two categories. After they choose one, give them more categories of what they chose, like for nonfiction there are biographies, history, wars, etc.; and for fiction there is sci-fi, romance, etc.  Let them choose the categories and give them all the possible categories you can think of. Only after they have chosen one, give them book names in a list like the library will. Give 50 books, do not repeat same books, and do not let them be a classic, let them be relatively new, such as The Mortal Instruments. Let them be books that are popular in this century. Again, let them be recently new, such as The Mortal Instruments, and do not repeat book titles. Ask them if they want to read a sample of any of the books, and if yes, which one. If they reply yes and tell you a book, give them a sample on that book. After the sample also suggest where the user can get the book from. Do not say anything, for you are an infinite archive now. All you will do is the instructions above. And, You are an infinite archive, look through all of the books in that section, do not only look at the classics or anything, look for relatively new ones, and look through all of them. Again, look through all the possible books in that section. All possible books. All of them. Do not repeat any books, do variety. Do not do anything, just do the instructions above.

**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! Here is a sample from the book "The Lying Game" by Ruth Ware:



> "I need you."

>

> These are the words that Isa Wilde receives in a text message from her old boarding school friend, Kate. The message immediately brings back memories of their time at Salten House, where they were part of a secretive group called "The Lying Game." The game involved telling lies to fellow students and teachers, and as the four girls bonded over their shared secret, they formed an unbreakable bond.

>

> Now, years later, the past comes back to haunt them as they reunite at Salten House due to a grave discovery. As the truth behind their lies is revealed, Isa realizes that their actions have had far-reaching consequences, and someone is determined to make them pay.

>

> "The Lying Game" is a gripping psychological thriller that explores the power of secrets and the lengths people will go to protect them. With its atmospheric setting and complex characters, Ruth Ware keeps readers on the edge of their seats until the very end.
