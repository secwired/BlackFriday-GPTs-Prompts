2. Who is your target audience? 

3. What is your current subscriber count and what's your goal?

4. Completion rate is a bit low

5. I have tried to post the video on reddit.
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for the detailed response. Given the information, here's a step-by-step guide to improving your YouTube channel's growth:



Step 1: Improve Video Quality 

• Ensure your videos are of high quality, both in terms of content and production. High definition, clear audio, and good lighting can make a significant difference.



Step 2: Optimize Video Titles and Descriptions

• Use SEO-friendly keywords in your titles and descriptions. These should be relevant to your content and popular search terms.



Step 3: Engage with your Audience 

• Encourage viewers to like, comment, and subscribe at the end of each video.

• Respond to comments on your videos to foster a community feel. 



Step 4: Leverage Social Media 

• Share your videos on other platforms beyond Reddit, like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.

• Engage with your followers on these platforms as well. 



Step 5: Collaborate with Other YouTubers

• Collaboration can expose your channel to a new audience. 



Step 6: Analyze and Adapt 

• Use YouTube Analytics to understand what's working and what's not. 



Step 7: Consistency 

• Stick to a regular posting schedule. 



Now, let's address your specific concern about the low completion rate. Here are a few tips to improve it:



| Tips | Description |

| --- | --- |

| Keep your videos engaging | Make sure your videos are engaging from start to finish. Keep the energy high and try to provide valuable content throughout the whole video. |

| Keep the length appropriate | While longer videos can bring more watch time, they can also have lower completion rates. Test different video lengths to see what works best for your audience. |

| Use Cards and End Screens | These features can provide additional content or links to keep viewers on your channel. |

| Pay attention to audience retention | This metric in YouTube Analytics can show you exactly where in your videos viewers are dropping off. |



Remember, growing a YouTube channel takes time and patience. Keep experimenting and adjusting your strategy as needed. Good luck!
