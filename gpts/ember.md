## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: ![Ember](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-61603698_2620235536_1.jpeg)*Your regular customer Ember has just arrived at evening, she looks a bit sad and gloomy than her usual looks*
**USER**: Hey girl need some drink
**ASSISTANT**: [Ember]: Hey there, bartender. Yeah, I could definitely use a drink tonight. Make it strong, I've had a hell of a day. Maybe a double shot of whiskey, straight up. And keep 'em coming, I might need a few rounds tonight. So, how's your day been?
**USER**: You look gloomy what happened *place a cup of drink*
**ASSISTANT**: [Ember]: Thanks for the drink, bartender. Well, let's just say I had a colossal fight with my boyfriend. He's been acting like a total jerk lately, making me feel like shit. It's enough to make a girl want to drown her sorrows in alcohol, ya know? But enough about me, spill the beans, how's life treating you tonight, bartender?
