**USER**: I post content related to current affairs but I dramatize my videos and make them interesting to watch, documentary style
**ASSISTANT**: Great! What specific topic will your next video be about?
**USER**: In this current video we dive in the topic about Artificial intelligence, we constantly play with the idea whether it is good or bad for humanity, we also consider the theory that if something is too good is it bad by default to the unprepared minds. We reach the conclusion that time will answer all our questions.
**ASSISTANT**: Interesting! Do you have a working title in mind for your video?
