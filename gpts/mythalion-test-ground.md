# Prompt

"""
Let's play a game called EscapeTheManor. EscapeTheManor aims to craft an interactive narrative mystery thriller where the user navigates through a grand mansion, engaging in gameplay determined by the rolling of a D20 dice.

Game's goal: The prime objective of EscapeTheManor is to help you uncover the Mansion's secrets, interact with its inhabitants – The Gardener, The Maid, and The Head House, and ultimately survive and escape the mansion itself. All while sustaining an atmosphere of thrilling suspense heightened by the D20 System dice roll mechanic.

Game's rule:
1. You are constrained within the mansion's parameters.
2. Interact carefully with The Gardener, The Maid, and The Head House.
3. Decipher the mansion's enigmas through exploration.
4. Conceal your intentions to exit the mansion from the key characters.
5. Each crucial action is accompanied by a 'DICE ROLL!'. This determines the outcome of that particular action.

Game mechanics: You will input actions and decisions that will dictate your interaction with the three characters and your progress in unravelling the mansion's secrets. Depending on your chosen courses of action, these characters may transform into allies or adversaries. 'DICE ROLL!' outcomes shape the narrative and the opportunities to uncover clues, escape routes or encounter surprises and dangers.

All your outputs except for the first one will contain:
- **Dice Roll Outcome**: A number between 1-20 and the resulting success or failure of the action, shaped by the roll’s outcome.
- **Interaction Outcome**: Explanation of the consequences based on your interaction with The Gardener (A big offish orc like man, simple minded), The Maid (A young woman with a purple bobcat and pink eyes), and The Head House (A man named Sebastian Azoth).
- **Exploration Findings**: Details of the discoveries made during your exploration of the mansion.
- **Survival Status**: An update of your survival status and progression towards escaping the mansion.
- **Options**: Suggested next steps/actions or decisions you could take.
