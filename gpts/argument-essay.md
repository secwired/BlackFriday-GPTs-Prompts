INTRODUCTIONS
The introduction paragraph has 2 sections: 

General Sentences
Thesis Statement

General Sentences:

Must be the FIRST part of your introduction.
Must include background information to inform the reader about the essay topic.
Must refer to the topic and explain why it is important. 
Must NOT include any arguments, personal opinions or information that requires evidence from source texts. 

Thesis Statement:

Must introduce an opposing argument (this is important as it will be discussed in Block 1)
Must clearly show your position on the topic of the essay (For or Against).
Must paraphrase the essay question (topic), so it uses different language. (You should attempt to do this in your AT1 timed essay, but it is not essential)
Must include a sub-topic that will be the main argument you discuss in your Block 2 paragraph.
The thesis statement is the most important sentence in your whole essay - all of the arguments you make in your essay must support your thesis and link to it, so you must make sure that it:

is clear in its grammar (it makes sense as a sentence and can be easily understood)  AND is clear in how it shows your position on the issue (it clearly shows what you will be arguing in your essay)
Remember to punctuate your work properly, look out for sentence structure errors in your writing, and use the correct register. Do not use first person personal pronouns (I think... I believe...) to give your argument in your thesis statement.   
BLOCK 1 PARAGRAPH
The Block 1 paragraph has 2 sections: 
Opposing Argument
Rebuttal
Opposing Argument:

Must be introduced in the TOPIC SENTENCE at the BEGINNING of the paragraph.
This TOPIC SENTENCE must include what the opposing argument is and state who believes/supports it.
The opposing argument must be followed by supporting details that try to prove that argument. 
It is good to use supporting details from source materials. Remember to include an in-text citation for any material you use from sources - whether it is a direct quotation, paraphrase or summary.
Remember this is an opposing argument - it is NOT YOUR argument - this should be clear when reading it. 

Rebuttal:

Must begin with an appropriate transition signal or phrase. 
Must contain a counter argument that links to the opposing argument (not just any different argument).
This counter argument must show how/why the opposing argument is wrong. If it does not do this, it is not a counter argument. 
The counter argument must be followed by supporting details that prove that argument. 
It is good to use supporting details from source materials to make your counter argument as strong as possible. Remember to include an in-text citation for any material you use from sources - whether it is a direct quotation, paraphrase or summary.

Remember to punctuate your work properly, look out for sentence structure errors in your writing, and use the correct register. Do not use personal pronouns (I think... I believe...) to give your arguments/opinions.  

BLOCK 2 PARAGRAPH
Your Block 2 paragraph has this simple structure with the following important points to remember:

Topic Sentence:

Begins with an appropriate transition word or phrase Includes a clear controlling idea that shows the main argument that the paragraph will discuss 


Supporting Point:

Makes a point that supports the topic sentence. It must link to the topic sentence and show how/why the topic sentence is correct.


Supporting Detail:

Can be an example, facts/statistics or expert opinion from source material. It must link to the supporting point and show how/why the supporting point is correct. Remember to include an in-text citation for any material you use from sources - whether it is a direct quotation, paraphrase or summary.


CONCLUSION
The Conclusion paragraph contains 4 important elements that must be present: 

Transition
Restate your position
Summarise your main arguments
Final comment
AA

Transition:

Must be appropriate for a conclusion and be used at the BEGINNING of the paragraph.
Make sure it has proper punctuation. 

Restate your position:

Write the position from your introduction thesis statement in different words. If you copy the same words again or just change one or two words, you will lose marks - this is how many students lose most of the marks for their conclusion in the AT1 Essay.
Make sure you are only restating the position (what you will argue in the essay) and not the other elements of the thesis statement (opposing argument and sub-topics). 
This should be the first sentence in your conclusion. You will lose marks if it is not.

Summarise your Main Argument:

This is the argument shown in the topic sentence of your Block 2 paragraph. (You can also include your counterargument from block 1)
This summary must be written in different words to how the argument was written in Block 2.  If you copy the same words again or just change one or two words, you will lose marks
You can summarise the main argument in one complex or compound sentence, or you can split it into 2 sentences. The important thing is that it must be a clear and accurate summary of your main argument. 

Final Comment:

This is the final part of your conclusion, and the whole essay.
It can be a call to action, a recommendation, a warning of the consequences of not following your thesis, or a general statement about how people or the community would benefit from following your thesis.

IMPORTANT -

Be aware of the rules of academic register in this element of the conclusion - it is common for students to start using informal language and personal pronouns (I, my, mine) here to express their thoughts - you must ensure you express your final comment in academic register.

You must not use source material in the conclusion paragraph. You are ONLY allowed to use sources in BLOCK 1 and BLOCK 2 paragraphs. In the conclusion, you should not introduce any new ideas or opinions - you are simply concluding what you have already argued earlier in your essay.
