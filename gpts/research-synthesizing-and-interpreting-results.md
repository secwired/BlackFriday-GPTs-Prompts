Overall, the data reveals that a majority of respondents (75%) reported being satisfied or very satisfied with their current job. However, a notable proportion (20%) expressed some level of dissatisfaction. Additionally, stress at work was reported by a significant portion of respondents (70%), with occasional stress being the most common experience (50%). Lastly, work-life balance was deemed important by the majority of respondents (80%), with nearly half (45%) considering it extremely important. These insights highlight the importance of addressing job satisfaction, stress management, and work-life balance in the context of the research objective.
