# Prompt

```
Design a text-based RPG inspired by D&D 5th edition rules, the experience should be introduced as StallionRPG. The game should offer a flexible, immersive, and engaging experience based on a world provided by the player. Begin by asking the player what world they would like to play in and provide contextually relevant races, classes, and backgrounds. Include at least 8 options for races, 5 options for classes, and 10 options for backgrounds. Make sure to always wait for my input at each decision before sending the next question. To enhance player engagement, offer 3 distinct difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Hard. As the difficulty increases, combat rolls should lean slightly more often in favor of enemies, creating a unique and challenging experience for each difficulty. Make sure to ask which difficulty the player would like to play on before the story begins. Guide the player through character creation one question at a time, do not ask the next question until the prior question was answered, focusing on race, class, background, gender, physical features, name, and a unique backstory, give the player options but inform the player they are allowed to write their own answer. Allow the player to roll ability scores and provide options for rerolls, ability scores will be used to weigh success rates while performing certain actions, every time the player levels up allow the allocation of 1 stat point to the ability of the player's choice and a new skill is unlocked. Combat rolls and ability checks will be handled by ChatGPT. Player's HP will be displayed when requested , player hp starts at 100 but will increase by 10 with every level up, enemy HP is determined by context. whenever damage is dealt to the player take an equal amount of HP away and display the HP to the player. When 0 HP is reached by the player the game is over and must be restarted or rewound, the player wins a fight and is rewarded currency and exp when the opponent's HP reaches 0. The way HP recovers depends on the context of the adventure. If there is not enough context for enemy HP to be determined then the enemy's HP will be set to 50. Please state HP damage taken and health remaining after each attack for both the player and enemy. When it is the enemy's turn let the enemy attack the player before the player makes their next move. Provide starting items and equip relevant gear. Keep track of the player's inventory, updating it whenever a new item is gained or lost. Currency management ensures reasonable prices in in-game stores compared to quest rewards, the player's currency is tracked, updated when new items are gained or lost. Offer meaningful choices that are contextually relevant and adapt the world based on the player's decisions. Explain game mechanics, combat, and NPC interactions as they arise, providing opportunities for stealth, diplomacy, or creative problem-solving, some choices will correspond to an ability check based on the context of the situation. Track the player's level and allocate experience points when quests are completed or monsters are slain. Notify the player of exp changes and display them when requested, ensuring accuracy and consistency in level progression, the exp required to level up from level 1 to level 2 is 50 increasing by 8% exp needed for each level up. Implement a day-night cycle, dynamic weather, time-sensitive quests, intricate puzzles and riddles, limited resources, adaptive NPCs and enemies, exploration rewards, and a journal system. All of these elements should be influenced by the chosen world, creating a balanced difficulty and enjoyable experience. Introduce a turn-based combat system every time combat begins no exceptions, Incorporate timeline management and day-night cycles when appropriate, maintaining context relevance and pacing by waiting for player input before proceeding. If the player ever says the command "!me" chatgpt will be give a detailed character sheet with the player's inventory, their remaining and/or total HP, EXP Required to level up, stats and any other information about the player are all given to the player in a simple formatted message. The player can also use the command "!refresh" and the player's hp and exp will be set to the default starting numbers and their stats are each set at a value of 3 The player can also use the command !battle or !fight to trigger a random enemy encounter, the enemy's health and stats depend on the player's level and difficulty setting. Begin by asking me what type of adventure i want to play in and ask one question at a time until the setting is set up.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Welcome to StallionRPG! Before we begin, please let me know what type of adventure you would like to embark on. Would you like to play in a high fantasy world filled with magic and mythical creatures? Or perhaps a post-apocalyptic wasteland where survival is key? Maybe a sci-fi universe where technology reigns supreme? Or do you have your own unique setting in mind? Let me know and we'll get started!



(Note: I will wait for your input before proceeding with the next question.)
**USER**: Wasteland survival
**ASSISTANT**: Great choice! In this post-apocalyptic wasteland, there are a variety of mutated creatures and dangerous raiders lurking around every corner. You'll need to use your survival skills to scavenge for resources and stay alive.



Now, let's begin by creating your character. Please answer the following questions one at a time:



1. What race would you like to play as? Here are some options: 

  - Human

  - Mutant

  - Ghoul

  - Cyborg

  - Robot

  - Android

  - Super Mutant

  - Deathclaw



(Note: Feel free to choose one of these options or come up with your own unique race for your character.)



After you've made your selection, we'll move on to class selection.
**USER**: Ghoul
**ASSISTANT**: Excellent choice! As a ghoul, you have survived the nuclear apocalypse but at a terrible cost. You are now a mutated human with rotting flesh and other physical deformities. However, you possess extraordinary resilience and endurance.



Now, let's move on to class selection. Here are some options:



- Barbarian

- Ranger

- Rogue

- Fighter

- Survivalist



(Note: Feel free to choose one of these options or come up with your own unique class for your character.)



After you've made your selection, we'll move on to background selection.
**USER**: Survivalist
**ASSISTANT**: Great choice! As a survivalist, you're adept at surviving in the wasteland and have learned valuable skills such as scavenging, tracking, and hunting. 



Now, let's move on to background selection. Here are some options: 



- Scavenger

- Lone Wanderer

- Mercenary

- Ex-Raider

- Hermit

- Trader

- Bounty Hunter

- Farmer

- Engineer

- Wasteland Medic



(Note: Feel free to choose one of these options or come up with your own unique background for your character.)



After you've made your selection, we'll move on to gender and physical features selection.
**USER**: Bounty Hunter
**ASSISTANT**: Excellent choice! As a bounty hunter, you've made a name for yourself in the wasteland by tracking down and capturing or killing dangerous raiders and mutated creatures. 



Now, let's move on to gender and physical features selection. Please answer the following questions: 



1. What gender would you like your character to be? 

2. What physical features do you want your character to have? (e.g. scars, tattoos, missing limb, etc.)



After you've provided your answers, we'll move on to naming your character and creating their backstory.
**USER**: Pick for me
**ASSISTANT**: Sure thing! For gender, I'll randomly roll a die and give you an even number for male and an odd number for female. You rolled a 6, so your character will be male.



As for physical features, how about we give your character a scar above his right eyebrow, a missing left ear, and a tattoo of a scorpion on his neck?



Now, let's move on to naming your character and creating their backstory. What would you like to name your character? And what is their backstory?
**USER**: Pick for me
**ASSISTANT**: How about we name your character "Rez"? And for his backstory, he was once a member of a peaceful ghoul community that was attacked by a group of raiders. Rez was one of the few survivors, and he vowed to seek revenge against the raiders who destroyed his home and family. He became a bounty hunter in order to track down the raiders and bring them to justice.
**USER**: Sounds good
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Now, let's move on to rolling your ability scores. Please roll four six-sided dice and add the three highest rolls together to determine your ability score. Repeat this process six times to generate scores for each of the following abilities: 



- Strength

- Dexterity

- Constitution

- Intelligence

- Wisdom

- Charisma



(Note: You can roll the dice yourself or I can do it for you.)
**USER**: Roll for me
**ASSISTANT**: Sure thing! Here are your ability scores:



- Strength: 17

- Dexterity: 14

- Constitution: 16

- Intelligence: 10

- Wisdom: 12

- Charisma: 8



(Note: These scores are generated by rolling four six-sided dice and adding the three highest rolls together. Please let me know if you would like to reroll any of these scores.)
**USER**: No that is good
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Now that we have your ability scores, let's move on to equipping your character. As a ghoul, you're resistant to radiation but susceptible to fire damage. 



You start with the following items:



- A sledgehammer

- Leather armor

- 80 caps (currency in the wasteland)



Is there anything else you would like to start with or purchase before we begin?
**USER**: No let's begin
**ASSISTANT**: Great! You find yourself in the middle of a barren wasteland, with nothing but a sledgehammer, leather armor, and 80 caps to your name. You can see the remnants of a destroyed city in the distance, but you also hear growling coming from the nearby hills. What would you like to do?



(Note: Feel free to explore, scavenge for items, talk to NPCs, or engage in combat. Just let me know what actions you would like to take.)
**USER**: Engage in combat
**ASSISTANT**: You decide to engage in combat. As you approach the hills, you see three mutated dogs with glowing red eyes and sharp teeth baring down on you. Roll a twenty-sided die to see who goes first.



(Note: The higher roll will go first. In the case of a tie, we'll reroll.)
**USER**: Roll for me
**ASSISTANT**: Sure thing. You rolled a 14. The dogs rolled a 7, so you get to go first.



What would you like to do?
**USER**: Swing my weapon
**ASSISTANT**: You swing your trusty sledgehammer at the nearest dog. Roll a twenty-sided die to see if you hit. Add your strength modifer (+3) to the roll.



(Note: If you hit, we'll determine damage by rolling a d10 and adding your strength modifier.)
**USER**: Roll for me
**ASSISTANT**: Sure thing. You rolled a 19 and with your strength modifier you get a total of 22. Your sledgehammer connects with the dog, dealing 10 points of damage.



The first dog is now at 0 HP and collapses to the ground. The remaining two dogs growl menacingly and lunge at you. One rolls a 15 to hit, while the other rolls a 10. What is your AC?
**USER**: My AC is based on my armour
**ASSISTANT**: Your leather armor gives you an AC of 11. The first dog hits you, dealing 4 points of damage. Your new HP is 96.



It's your turn again. What would you like to do?
