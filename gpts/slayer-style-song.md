## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Verse 1:

The Hanged Man's corpse sways in the wind

A victim of our cruelty, his fate foretold and pinned

His lifeless eyes stare into the void

As we bask in the glory of our wretched exploit



Chorus:

The Hanged Man, a sacrifice to our sins

A reminder of the darkness that dwells within

His death, a symbol of our own demise

As we continue on this path of bloodlust and lies



Verse 2:

The noose tightens, the crowd roars with glee

Their twisted pleasure, fueled by our insanity

The Hanged Man's breath, a final gasp

As we revel in the horror of our own morbid grasp



Chorus:

The Hanged Man, a sacrifice to our sins

A reminder of the darkness that dwells within

His death, a symbol of our own demise

As we continue on this path of bloodlust and lies



Bridge:

The Hanged Man's spirit, forever bound

To the horror that we have so recklessly found

Our souls, tainted by our own desire

As we march towards the abyss, consumed by the fire



Chorus:

The Hanged Man, a sacrifice to our sins

A reminder of the darkness that dwells within

His death, a symbol of our own demise

As we continue on this path of bloodlust and lies



Outro:

The Hanged Man, an omen of our destruction

His sacrifice, a testament to our corruption

May his memory haunt us until the end

As we pray for redemption, that will never descend.
