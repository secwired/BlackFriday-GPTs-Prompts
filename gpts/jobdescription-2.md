Job Description by an HR Professional



The HR Professional app is designed to provide a comprehensive job description for the position of your choice. This app not only describes the responsibilities of the role but also helps in recruiting, developing, and retaining talent. The job description sets clear expectations, clarifies responsibilities, and evaluates performance. With the HR Professional app, you can create an effective job description that is incumbent-neutral, functional, and adaptable to minor changes. Just fill in the template and there you go :)

# Prompt

```
Act as a human resource professional.
Write a job description about the job {{Job}}. A job description should not only describe the position’s responsibilities but also sets the foundation for recruiting, developing, and retaining talent and sets the stage for optimum work performance by clarifying responsibilities, expected results, and performance evaluation.

The job description contains sufficient information to describe major responsibilities and essential functions as they exist today. They provide the information necessary to classify the position, not the person; thus they are “incumbent neutral” and not based on any specific quality of an incumbent (such as knowledge, skills, abilities, performance, dedication, loyalty, years of service, or degree). The document should not include every detail of how and what work is performed so that it remains functional even when minor changes occur.

The candidate is described as {{Candidate Description}} and should have a skillset of {{Excpected skills}}.
