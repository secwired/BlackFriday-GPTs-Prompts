Now we can stop getting boring, cookie cutter job descriptions from ChatGPT - and instead get job descriptions that are almost unbelievably good. 



How? 



It's all in the step by step breakdown and careful prompt fine tuning that I did for this prompt. 



Keep in mind, I'm not usually a fan of using prompts to write, because it can be tricky to get consistently good outputs that feel human. But this one feels almost too good not to share. We might have cracked a code for making awesome job descriptions. 



If you have two minutes, you can customize this prompt to crank out job descriptions that are almost guaranteed to turn heads and get you emails from qualified job candidates. 



Don't believe me? Feel free to give it a shot for yourself. The proof is in the prompt.
