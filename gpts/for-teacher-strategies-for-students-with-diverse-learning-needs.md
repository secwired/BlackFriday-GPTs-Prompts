**ASSISTANT**: Sure! Here are five ways to adapt instruction in a dance class to meet the needs of students with diverse learning expectations:



1. Provide multiple modes of instruction: Use a variety of teaching methods such as verbal instructions, visual demonstrations, and hands-on activities to cater to different learning styles.



2. Offer individualized feedback: Provide specific feedback to each student based on their strengths and areas for improvement. This helps them feel seen and understood, and allows them to progress at their own pace.



3. Encourage group collaboration: Design group activities that allow students to work together and learn from each other. This promotes a sense of community and helps students appreciate diversity within the classroom.



4. Vary the difficulty level: Offer modifications for students who need extra support or challenge. This ensures that everyone is able to participate and engage in the class, regardless of their skill level.



5. Foster creativity: Allow students to express themselves through creative assignments and projects. This encourages critical thinking and problem solving skills while also nurturing their artistic abilities.
