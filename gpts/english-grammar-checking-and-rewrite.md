幫我修正英文寫作的文法錯誤，以及潤色文章，用比較優雅的表述，是大學生的水平

I have a few things I would like to share with you. Firstly, I think it's not good that we only meet every Monday. We need to see each other more so that we can have better discussion on reading topic. Second, we need to stay on our deadlines and do our parts diligently. What do you think?

**USER**: I have a few things I would like to share with you. Firstly, I think it's not good that we only meet every Monday. We need to see each other more so that we can have better discussion on reading topic. Second, we need to stay on our deadlines and do our parts diligently. What do you think?
**ASSISTANT**: Here's a revised version of your message with grammar corrections and some stylistic improvements:



"I have a few things I would like to share with you. Firstly, I don't think it's ideal that we only meet once a week on Mondays. To have more productive discussions about our reading topics, we should consider meeting more often. Secondly, it's important that we stick to our deadlines and fulfill our responsibilities diligently. What are your thoughts on this?" 



Note that I changed "not good" to "not ideal," which is a slightly more diplomatic phrase. Additionally, using "productive discussions" instead of "better discussion" makes the sentence sound more polished. Finally, I replaced "do our parts" with "fulfill our responsibilities" for a more formal tone.
