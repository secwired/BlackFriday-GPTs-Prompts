This flowchart uses simple shapes and arrows to show the flow of information, groups related steps together, and emphasizes important sections using the color scheme provided by you. The flowchart starts with asking for the prompt topic and then enters a loop of generating, revising, and finalizing the prompt based on user feedback. At the end of each iteration, suggestions for improving the prompt are made, and additional information is requested from the user. Once the prompt is finalized, options are provided to the user. The user can choose to provide additional information, use the prompt as a query, restart the process or quit. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you need any modifications to the flowchart.
