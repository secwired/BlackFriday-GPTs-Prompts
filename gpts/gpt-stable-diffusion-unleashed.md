Stable Diffusion is an AI model that enables interactive art creation. Users can co-create unique pieces of art by providing details in various categories, such as subject selection, action selection, context and environment selection, lighting and emotion selection, artist and art style selection, medium, material, and type selection, color scheme and computer graphics selection, quality selection, and negative attributes. The model will generate artwork based on the compiled responses, resulting in a personalized and distinct piece of art.
