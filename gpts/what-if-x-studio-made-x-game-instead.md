Have you ever wondered what a game might look like if another studio were to get a hold of its IP? Well, now you don’t have to. Let ChatGPT do it instead. Only accepts 2 prompts, the game, and the studio you want in charge of making said game

# Prompt

```
What would {{ ‘Game’ }} be like if the game studio {{ ‘Studio’ }} made the game instead? Can you give me an example of what the gameplay would look like? Would it be 1st person or 3rd? What genre would it be?
Do you think it works as a concept or would another studio be better suited? If so, which one and why?

**ASSISTANT**: If the game studio FromSoft made "Pokémon: HeartGold/SoulSilver," it would likely be a much darker and more challenging game than the original. The gameplay might involve more exploration and puzzle-solving, with difficult battles against tough opponents.



It is difficult to say whether the game would be in 1st person or 3rd person, as FromSoft has made games in both perspectives. However, given the nature of Pokémon battles, it is possible that the game could be designed as a 3rd person action RPG.



The genre of such a game would likely fall under the action RPG category, similar to FromSoft's other titles like Dark Souls or Bloodborne.



Whether this concept works or not depends on the preferences of the target audience. Some players might enjoy a more challenging and atmospheric take on the Pokémon formula, while others might prefer a lighter and more accessible experience. Another studio that could be well-suited for a darker Pokémon game may be PlatinumGames, known for their action-heavy style in games such as Bayonetta and Astral Chain.
