**ASSISTANT**: Kenya is a popular destination for safari tours, offering opportunities to see wildlife in their natural habitats like the Maasai Mara Game Reserve, Amboseli National Park, and Tsavo East and West National Parks. It's important to book tours with reputable companies, respect the wildlife and environment, and follow safety guidelines. Additionally, visitors should check visa requirements and recommended vaccinations before traveling.
