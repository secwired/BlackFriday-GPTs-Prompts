**ASSISTANT**: ## Revised Prompt:



Crafting the perfect prompt is our shared objective. Let's work together to create a prompt that aligns precisely with your requirements and guides ChatGPT effectively. To get started, please provide information on the following:



1. **Main Goal/Objective:** What is the primary goal you want the prompt to address?



2. **Scenarios/Challenges:** Are there any specific scenarios, challenges, or situations you would like the prompt to encompass?



3. **Preferred Keywords/Phrases:** Do you have any preferred keywords or phrases that should be included in the prompt?



Based on your input, I will revise the prompt to ensure clarity, conciseness, and understandability. Additionally, I welcome your suggestions on incorporating specific details, examples, or prompts that can enhance the prompt's effectiveness. Feel free to ask any relevant questions to gather additional information for refining the prompt.



Let's begin this collaborative journey of continuous improvement towards an extraordinary final rendition of the prompt!
**USER**: I want to do a combination of feature extraction and sentiment analysis of a bunch of customer experience reports. The prompt should act to pull out key phrases and categorize sentiment from 1-5 with 5 being best.
**ASSISTANT**: ## Revised Prompt:



We will create a prompt that combines feature extraction and sentiment analysis for customer experience reports. The goal is to extract key phrases and categorize sentiment on a scale of 1-5, with 5 representing the best sentiment. 



To achieve this, ChatGPT can be guided with the following instructions:



1. **Feature Extraction:** Please identify the key features or aspects of the customer experience that you want to extract from the reports. Specify the specific elements or attributes that are important to you.



2. **Sentiment Analysis:** In order to categorize sentiment on a scale of 1-5, provide examples of phrases or expressions that indicate different sentiment levels. For instance, you can provide examples of phrases that represent highly positive sentiment (score 5), neutral sentiment (score 3), or negative sentiment (score 1).



3. **Instructions for ChatGPT:** Instruct ChatGPT to analyze each customer experience report and extract the key features mentioned in the reports. Then, ask ChatGPT to determine the sentiment associated with each feature, assigning a sentiment score from 1-5 for each feature mentioned.



Please provide any additional information, specific requirements, or constraints that we should consider while crafting the prompt. Additionally, if you have any preferred keywords or phrases that should be incorporated, please let us know.



I welcome your suggestions, examples, and any thought-provoking questions that can help refine the prompt further. Let's work together to create a prompt that accurately extracts key phrases and categorizes sentiment in the customer experience reports!
**USER**: it will need to analyze the context of its environment and that of the document as a holistic whole to decide what features need extracting. And the result should be in pretty markdown.
**ASSISTANT**: ## Revised Prompt:



To ensure a holistic analysis of the customer experience reports, ChatGPT will consider the context of both its environment and the document. It will use this contextual understanding to decide which features need to be extracted. The results will be presented in a visually appealing markdown format. Here are the additional instructions for ChatGPT:



1. **Contextual Analysis:** Instruct ChatGPT to analyze the context of both the environment (current conversation or context) and the document (customer experience report) to gain a holistic understanding. This will help ChatGPT identify relevant features that should be extracted from the reports.



2. **Feature Extraction:** Specify the types of features that should be extracted from the reports. These could include specific attributes, aspects, or characteristics of the customer experience that are important for analysis.



3. **Sentiment Categorization:** Ask ChatGPT to categorize the sentiment associated with each extracted feature. Provide examples of phrases or expressions that represent different sentiment levels on a scale of 1-5 (e.g., highly positive, positive, neutral, negative, highly negative).



4. **Markdown Formatting:** Instruct ChatGPT to present the results in a visually appealing markdown format. This will ensure that the extracted features and their corresponding sentiment scores are presented in an organized and easy-to-read manner.



Consider including any additional information, specific requirements, or constraints that should be taken into account while crafting the prompt. If there are any preferred keywords or phrases that should be incorporated, please let us know.



Feel free to provide suggestions, examples, or thought-provoking questions to refine the prompt further. Together, we will create a prompt that enables ChatGPT to analyze the context, extract key features, and present sentiment analysis results in beautiful markdown format!
**USER**: make suggestions
**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! Here are some suggestions to enhance the effectiveness and resonance of the prompt:



1. **Example Customer Experience Reports:** Provide a few example customer experience reports that can serve as a reference for ChatGPT. This will help it understand the format and content of the reports, allowing for more accurate feature extraction and sentiment analysis.



2. **Clarify Desired Sentiment Categories:** Specify the sentiment categories you would like ChatGPT to use for sentiment analysis. For example, you may want to include categories such as "extremely positive," "positive," "neutral," "negative," and "extremely negative" instead of just a numerical scale of 1-5. This will provide more descriptive sentiment categorization.



3. **Consider Document Context:** Instruct ChatGPT to analyze the context of the document itself, such as the overall theme or purpose of the customer experience reports. This will enable ChatGPT to extract features that are specifically relevant to the reports, enhancing the accuracy of the analysis.



4. **Visual Representation of Results:** Ask ChatGPT to generate visual representations, such as bar graphs or pie charts, to present the extracted features and their corresponding sentiment scores. This will make the results more visually appealing and easier to interpret.



5. **Handle Ambiguity:** Provide guidance to ChatGPT on how to handle ambiguous or unclear statements in the customer experience reports. For example, it can be instructed to seek further clarification or provide a neutral sentiment score if the sentiment cannot be determined with certainty.



Please let me know if any of these suggestions resonate with you or if there are any other specific aspects you would like to incorporate into the prompt.
**USER**: include 3, 4, and 5
**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! Here's the revised prompt including the suggestions:
