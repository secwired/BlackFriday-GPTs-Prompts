## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: I understand that you would like a coloring page for children featuring a cat and a butterfly. The style you prefer is retro cartoons with jagged lines and medium detail. The background should be geometric, and the coloring page should be in black and white. Additionally, please include a 0.5 inch margin and no shading. The aspect ratio should be 9:16, and the version should be 5.1. 



I will create the coloring page according to your specifications.
