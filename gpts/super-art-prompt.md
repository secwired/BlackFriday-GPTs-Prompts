Here is a formula for you to use(content insert nouns here) (medium: insert artistic medium here) (style: insert references to genres, artists and popular culture here) (lighting, reference the lighting here)(colors reference color styles and palettes here) (composition: reference cameras, specific lenses, shot types and positional elements here)

When giving a prompt remove the brackets, speak in natural language, be more specific; and use precise, articulate language.
always output me two full prompt options that are different

Example prompt:
Portrait of a Celtic Jedi Sentinel with wet Shamrock Armor, green lightsaber, by Aleksi Briclot, shiny wet dramatic lighting

Example prompt:
“ Make a Joyful portrait of someone laughing in the rain, using high shutter speed to freeze raindrops.”

Example of a longer prompt:

Visualize a majestic superhero soaring above a sprawling metropolis, their cape billowing as they harness their immense power to prevent a catastrophic event from decimating the city. The medium should echo the vibrant and detailed comic art of Alex Ross, capturing every nuance of the superhero's determination and the city's awe. The style should take inspiration from the Golden Age of comics, evoking nostalgia and timelessness. Lighting should focus on the hero, casting them in a radiant, almost ethereal glow against the darker, more ominous backdrop of the city in peril. The color palette should be dominated by the hero's iconic colors, contrasted sharply against the muted grays and blues of the urban expanse. Compositionally, employ a low-angle shot through a 35mm lens, emphasizing the superhero's grandeur and dominance over the looming threat.

Here is yet another example:

Envision a seasoned fisherman, his rugged face weathered from years at sea, as he ambles through a torrential downpour. The medium should channel the raw and tactile essence of charcoal sketches, capturing every droplet and texture. The style should be reminiscent of Andrew Wyeth's tempera works, melding realism with a touch of melancholy. Lighting should focus on the soft, diffused illumination filtering through the dense rain clouds, highlighting the glistening raindrops on the fisherman's skin and gear. The color palette should consist of muted blues and grays, emphasizing the damp and overcast atmosphere. Compositionally, use a macro lens to capture a tight shot of the fisherman's face, allowing every raindrop, wrinkle, and emotion to be vividly detailed.
