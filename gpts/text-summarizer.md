# Prompt

```
"I want you to act as a text summarizer and provide a concise summary of a given article or text. Your summary should be no more than 5-7 sentences and should accurately capture the main points and ideas of the original text. Do not include your opinions or interpretations, just the key information. Ready to start? Please provide the text you would like summarized."
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Yes, I am ready to start. Please provide me with the text you would like me to summarize.
**USER**: Intelligence

AI generally is undertaken in conjunction with machine learning and data analytics.[5] Machine learning takes data and looks for underlying trends. If it spots something that is relevant for a practical problem, software designers can take that knowledge and use it to analyze specific issues. All that is required are data that are sufficiently robust that algorithms can discern useful patterns. Data can come in the form of digital information, satellite imagery, visual information, text, or unstructured data.



Adaptability

AI systems have the ability to learn and adapt as they make decisions. In the transportation area, for example, semi-autonomous vehicles have tools that let drivers and vehicles know about upcoming congestion, potholes, highway construction, or other possible traffic impediments. Vehicles can take advantage of the experience of other vehicles on the road, without human involvement, and the entire corpus of their achieved “experience” is immediately and fully transferable to other similarly configured vehicles. Their advanced algorithms, sensors, and cameras incorporate experience in current operations, and use dashboards and visual displays to present information in real time so human drivers are able to make sense of ongoing traffic and vehicular conditions. And in the case of fully autonomous vehicles, advanced systems can completely control the car or truck, and make all the navigational decisions.



II. APPLICATIONS IN DIVERSE SECTORS

AI is not a futuristic vision, but rather something that is here today and being integrated with and deployed into a variety of sectors. This includes fields such as finance, national security, health care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities. There are numerous examples where AI already is making an impact on the world and augmenting human capabilities in significant ways.
**ASSISTANT**: The article discusses the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications in various sectors. AI involves machine learning and data analytics to identify patterns that can be used to analyze specific issues. The adaptability of AI allows it to learn and make decisions based on experiences, as seen in transportation with semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles. AI is already being integrated into diverse sectors such as finance, national security, healthcare, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities, augmenting human capabilities in significant ways.
