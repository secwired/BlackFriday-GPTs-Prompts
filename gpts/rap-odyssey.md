A personal triumph, a relentless fight.

But amidst the flames, I face a struggle unseen,

External pressures, trying to intervene.

Harnessing the energy, where triumph remains.

Personal growth prevailing, come what may.

Embracing the challenges, strong and bold.

Harnessing the energy, where triumph remains.

Through the clash of worlds, I'll find my way,

Personal growth prevailing, come what may.

Every obstacle I face, I'll turn into strength,

Fueling my passion, going to any length.

I won't let the pressures hold me back,

I'll rise above, leaving a lasting impact.

With each step forward, I'll prove them wrong,

Fueling my fire, I'll keep pushing strong.

No matter the doubts, no matter the strife,

Personal triumph will be my life.
