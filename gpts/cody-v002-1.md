**ASSISTANT**: It looks like you're working on a Flask web application. Flask is a popular Python web framework for building web applications.



Here's a breakdown of your code:



1. You import the Flask module and create an instance of the Flask class, named `app`. The `__name__` variable is a special variable in Python that represents the name of the current module. This is necessary for Flask to know where to look for resources such as templates and static files.



2. You set the `secret_key` attribute of the `app` object. The secret key is used for securely signing the session cookie and other security-related features in Flask.



3. You set the `debug` attribute of the `app` object to `True`. This enables debug mode, which provides more detailed error messages and automatically reloads the server when changes are made to the code. It's recommended to set this to `False` in production.



4. You define a route for the `/images/favicon.ico` URL, which returns the static file `favicon.ico` located in the `/images` directory.



5. You define a route for the root URL `/`, which calls the `home` function. Inside the `home` function, you set the `title` variable to `'Home'` and render the `index.html` template, passing the `title` variable to the template.



6. You define a route for the `/login.html` URL, which calls the `login_page` function. Inside the `login_page` function, you set the `title` variable to `'login_page'` and render the `login.html` template, passing the `title` variable to the template.



7. You define a route for the `/login` URL with the methods `GET` and `POST`, which calls the `login` function. Inside the `login` function, you check if the request method is `POST`. If it is, you perform authentication and set the `session['logged_in']` variable to `True`. If the authentication is successful, you redirect the user to the `home` route. If the request method is `GET`, you render the `login.html` template.



8. You define a route for the `/logout` URL, which calls the `logout` function. Inside the `logout` function, you set the `session['logged_in']` variable to `False` and redirect the user to the `home` route.



9. You define a route for the `/settings.html` URL, which calls the `settings` function. Inside the `settings` function, you set the `title` variable to `'settings'` and render the `settings.html` template, passing the `title` variable to the template.



10. You define a route for the `/script.php` URL, which calls the `page` function. Inside the `page` function, you render the `script.php` template.



11. You define an error handler for the 404 status code, which calls the `page_not_found` function. Inside the `page_not_found` function, you render the `404.html` template and return a 404 status code.



12. You define an error handler for the 500 status code, which calls the `server_error` function. Inside the `server_error` function, you render the `500.html` template and return a 500 status code.



13. Finally, you check if the `__name__` variable is equal to `'__main__'`, which means the script is being executed directly (not imported as a module). If it is, you start the Flask development server by calling the `app.run()` method.



Overall, your code sets up routes for different URLs and renders templates based on those routes. It also handles authentication, error handling, and runs the Flask development server.



Is there anything specific you would like assistance with or any questions you have about this code?
**USER**: In the login html how do I set the session as logged in

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>

    <title>Login</title>

    <style>

        /* Add your custom CSS styles here */



        /* Dark and sharp style */

        body {

            background-color: #222;

            color: #fff;

            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;

        }



        /* Login form styles */

        .login-form {

            margin-top: 100px;

            text-align: center;

        }

    </style>

</head>

<body>

    <div class="login-form">

        <form action="">

            <input type="text" placeholder="Username">

            <input type="password" placeholder="Password">

            <button type="submit">Login</button>

        </form>

        <p>Don't have an account? <a href="#">Register</a></p>

    </div>

</body>

</html>
**ASSISTANT**: To set the session as logged in when the user submits the login form, you need to modify the HTML code and add the necessary logic to handle the form submission.



Here's an updated version of the login HTML code:



```html

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>

    <title>Login</title>

    <style>

        /* Add your custom CSS styles here */



        /* Dark and sharp style */

        body {

            background-color: #222;

            color: #fff;

            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;

        }



        /* Login form styles */

        .login-form {

            margin-top: 100px;

            text-align: center;

        }

    </style>

</head>

<body>

    <div class="login-form">

        <form action="/login" method="POST">

            <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username">

            <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password">

            <button type="submit">Login</button>

        </form>

        <p>Don't have an account? <a href="#">Register</a></p>

    </div>

</body>

</html>

```



In the updated code:



1. The `<form>` element has been modified to include the `action` attribute set to `/login` and the `method` attribute set to `POST`. This means that when the user submits the form, it will send a POST request to the `/login` URL.



2. The `<input>` elements for the username and password fields now have the `name` attribute set to `"username"` and `"password"`, respectively. This is important because it allows you to access the values entered by the user in the Flask route.



Now, in your Flask code, you can access the form data and perform authentication. Here's an example of how you can update the `login` route to set the session as logged in:



```python

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])

def login():

    if request.method == 'POST':

        username = request.form.get('username')

        password = request.form.get('password')



        # Add your authentication code here

        # If authentication is successful, set session['logged_in'] to True

        if username == 'admin' and password == 'password':

            session['logged_in'] = True

            return redirect(url_for('home'))

        else:

            flash('Invalid username or password', 'error')

            return redirect(url_for('login_page'))

    else:

        # Handle GET request here

        return render_template('login.html')

```



In the updated code:



1. Inside the `login` function, you use `request.form.get('username')` and `request.form.get('password')` to retrieve the values entered by the user in the login form.



2. You can then perform your authentication logic. In this example, we're checking if the username is `'admin'` and the password is `'password'`. You should replace this with your own authentication logic.



3. If the authentication is successful, you set `session['logged_in']` to `True` and redirect the user to the `home` route.



4. If the authentication fails, you can use the `flash` function to display an error message. In this example, we're flashing the message `'Invalid username or password'` with the category `'error'`. You can modify this message to suit your needs.



5. In both cases (successful authentication or authentication failure), you redirect the user to the `login_page` route. This is done to clear the form fields and display any error messages.



Make sure you have the necessary imports for the `request`, `redirect`, `url_for`, `flash`, and `session` functions at the top of your Flask code:



```python

from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, flash, session

```



Remember to update the authentication logic in the code to match your requirements. This is just a basic example to demonstrate the concept.



Let me know if you have any further questions!
**USER**: I get a Add "lang" and/or "xml:lang" attributes to this "<html>" element what does that mean?
**ASSISTANT**: The error message "Add 'lang' and/or 'xml:lang' attributes to this '<html>' element" is a suggestion to add the 'lang' attribute to the `<html>` element in your HTML code.



The 'lang' attribute is used to specify the language of the document. It helps search engines and assistive technologies understand the language of the content, and it can also affect how the browser renders the page.



To address the error, you can add the 'lang' attribute to the `<html>` element and set it to the appropriate language code. For example, if your document is in English, you can set the 'lang' attribute to "en" for English:



```html

<html lang="en">

```



If your document is in a different language, you can use the appropriate language code. For example, for Spanish, you can set the 'lang' attribute to "es":



```html

<html lang="es">

```



Additionally, the error message mentions the 'xml:lang' attribute. This attribute is similar to the 'lang' attribute, but it is specifically used in XML documents. In HTML, you typically only need to use the 'lang' attribute.



Including the 'lang' attribute in the `<html>` element is considered good practice for accessibility and internationalization. It helps ensure that your web page is properly interpreted by both users and automated tools.



By adding the 'lang' attribute to the `<html>` element, you are indicating the language of the document, which can improve the user experience and search engine optimization.

**USER**: Here how do I set logged out?

</head>

<body>

    <div class="settings">

        <h2>Settings Page</h2>

        <div class="logout-form">

            <form action="index.html">

                <button type="submit">Login</button>

            </form>

            <p>Don't have an account? <a href="#">Register</a></p>

        </div>

    </div>

</body>

</html>
**ASSISTANT**: To implement a logout functionality in your HTML code, you can modify the form action and add a hidden input field to indicate the logout action. Here's an updated version of your HTML code:



```html

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>

    <title>Settings</title>

    <style>

        /* Add your custom CSS styles here */



        /* Dark and sharp style */

        body {

            background-color: #222;

            color: #fff;

            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;

        }



        /* Settings page styles */

        .settings {

            margin-top: 100px;

            text-align: center;

        }

    </style>

</head>

<body>

    <div class="settings">

        <h2>Settings Page</h2>

        <div class="logout-form">

            <form action="/logout" method="POST">

                <input type="hidden" name="logout" value="true">

                <button type="submit">Logout</button>

            </form>

            <p>Don't have an account? <a href="#">Register</a></p>

        </div>

    </div>

</body>

</html>

```



In the updated code:



1. The `<form>` element has been modified to include the `action` attribute set to `"/logout"` and the `method` attribute set to `"POST"`. This means that when the user submits the form, it will send a POST request to the `/logout` URL.



2. An `<input>` element of type "hidden" has been added to the form. This input field is used to indicate the logout action. It has the `name` attribute set to `"logout"` and the `value` attribute set to `"true"`. This hidden field will be sent along with the form submission to indicate that the user wants to logout.



3. The button within the form has been changed to say "Logout" instead of "Login" to reflect the action.



Now, in your Flask code, you can handle the logout action and clear the session. Here's an example of how you can update the `logout` route:



```python

@app.route('/logout', methods=['POST'])

def logout():

    if request.form.get('logout') == 'true':

        session['logged_in'] = False

        return redirect(url_for('home'))

    else:

        return redirect(url_for('settings'))

```



In the updated code:



1. Inside the `logout` function, you check if the value of `request.form.get('logout')` is equal to `'true'`. This checks if the logout action was triggered by the form submission.



2. If the logout action is detected, you set `session['logged_in']` to `False` to indicate that the user is logged out.



3. Finally, you redirect the user to the `home` route.



Make sure you have the necessary imports for the `request`, `redirect`, `url_for`, and `session` functions at the top of your Flask code:



```python

from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, session

```



Remember to update the logic in the code to match your requirements. This is just a basic example to demonstrate the concept.



Let me know if you have any further questions!
**USER**: So in this how would I add a simple auth that maybe just for testing uses plaintext to save login details, I'm good with db the main two anyways but I just want to test locally and focus on appearance and (test functionality)

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])

def login():

    if request.method == 'POST':

        username = request.form.get('username')

        password = request.form.get('password')



        # Add your authentication code here

        # If authentication is successful, set session['logged_in'] to True

        if username == 'admin' and password == 'password':

            session['logged_in'] = True

            return redirect(url_for('home'))

        else:

            flash('Invalid username or password', 'error')

            return redirect(url_for('login_page'))

    else:

        # Handle GET request here

        return render_template('login.html')
**ASSISTANT**: To add a simple authentication mechanism that uses plaintext to save login details for testing purposes, you can modify the `login` route in your Flask code. Here's an example of how you can implement it:



```python

import hashlib



# A dictionary to store the username and password combinations

users = {

    'admin': '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99'  # Password: password

}



@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])

def login():

    if request.method == 'POST':

        username = request.form.get('username')

        password = request.form.get('password')



        # Check if the username exists in the users dictionary

        if username in users:

            # Hash the entered password using MD5

            hashed_password = hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()



            # Compare the hashed password with the stored password

            if hashed_password == users[username]:

                session['logged_in'] = True

                return redirect(url_for('home'))

        

        flash('Invalid username or password', 'error')

        return redirect(url_for('login_page'))

    else:

        # Handle GET request here

        return render_template('login.html')

```



In the updated code:



1. The `users` dictionary is used to store the username and password combinations. In this example, we have a single user with the username `'admin'` and the password `'password'`. The password is hashed using the MD5 algorithm and stored as a hexadecimal string.



2. Inside the `login` function, the entered password is hashed using MD5 (`hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()`) and compared with the stored hashed password (`users[username]`). If the passwords match, the user is authenticated and `session['logged_in']` is set to `True`.



3. If the username or password is invalid, a flash message is displayed and the user is redirected to the `login_page`.



4. In the HTML code, make sure to update the form action to `action="/login"`.



Note that using plaintext to save login details is not secure and should not be used in a production environment. This example is for testing purposes only. In a production environment, it is recommended to use secure hashing algorithms and store hashed passwords with additional security measures.



Let me know if you have any further questions!
**USER**: I meant create a new register.html that saves the login to plaintext then login can check against the plaintext
**ASSISTANT**: I apologize for the confusion. If you want to create a new `register.html` page to allow users to register and save their login details in plaintext, you can follow these steps:



1. Create a new HTML file called `register.html` and add the following code:



```html

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>

    <title>Register</title>

    <style>

        /* Add your custom CSS styles here */



        /* Dark and sharp style */

        body {

            background-color: #222;

            color: #fff;

            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;

        }



        /* Register form styles */

        .register-form {

            margin-top: 100px;

            text-align: center;

        }

    </style>

</head>

<body>

    <div class="register-form">

        <form action="/register" method="POST">

            <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username">

            <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password">

            <button type="submit">Register</button>

        </form>

        <p>Already have an account? <a href="/login">Login</a></p>

    </div>

</body>

</html>

```



2. Update your Flask code to include a new route for the `register` page and a dictionary to store the registered usernames and passwords. Here's an example:



```python

# A dictionary to store the registered usernames and passwords

registered_users = {}



@app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])

def register():

    if request.method == 'POST':

        username = request.form.get('username')

        password = request.form.get('password')



        # Check if the username is already registered

        if username in registered_users:

            flash('Username already exists', 'error')

            return redirect(url_for('register'))

        

        # Save the username and password in plaintext

        registered_users[username] = password

        

        flash('Registration successful', 'success')

        return redirect(url_for('login'))

    else:

        # Handle GET request here

        return render_template('register.html')

```



In the updated code:



1. The `registered_users` dictionary is used to store the registered usernames and passwords. When a user registers, their username and password are saved in plaintext in this dictionary.



2. Inside the `register` function, the entered username is checked against the `registered_users` dictionary to ensure it is not already registered. If the username already exists, a flash message is displayed and the user is redirected back to the `register` page.



3. If the username is available, the username and password are saved in the `registered_users` dictionary.



4. After successful registration, a flash message is displayed, and the user is redirected to the `login` page.



Remember that storing passwords in plaintext is highly insecure and should never be done in a production environment. This example is for testing purposes only. In a real-world scenario, passwords should be securely hashed and stored using a secure hashing algorithm.

**ASSISTANT**: The issue you're facing is that when you click on the "Login" button on the index/home page, it takes you to the `login_action` route instead of the `login_page` route. This issue can be resolved by updating the HTML code in your `index.html` file.



In your `index.html` file, locate the form element that contains the "Login" button. Update the `action` attribute of the form to point to the `/login` route instead of `/login_action`. Here's the updated code:



```html

<form action="/login" method="POST">

    <button type="submit">Login</button>

</form>

```



By changing the `action` attribute to `/login`, the form will submit the login request to the correct route, which is the `login` route defined in your Flask code.



After making this change, clicking on the "Login" button on the index/home page should take you to the `login_page` route as expected.



Let me know if you have any further questions!

**ASSISTANT**: I apologize for the confusion. In that case, you can update the link in your `index.html` file to point to the correct login page.



In your `index.html` file, locate the anchor tag `<a>` that contains the "Login" link. Update the `href` attribute of the anchor tag to point to `/login` instead of `/login_page`. Here's the updated code:



```html

<a href="/login">Login</a>

```



By changing the `href` attribute to `/login`, clicking on the "Login" link on the index/home page will take you to the correct login page.



Let me know if you have any further questions!

**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for sharing the code for your Flask application. It seems like you have already implemented the basic functionality for user registration, login, and logout. However, I noticed that you mentioned saving the login password in plaintext, which is not recommended for security reasons. Storing passwords in plaintext can make your application vulnerable to attacks.



To enhance the security of your application, it is recommended to store hashed passwords instead of plaintext. You can use a cryptographic hashing algorithm like bcrypt to securely hash the passwords. Here's an updated version of your code that uses bcrypt to hash and verify passwords:



```python

from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, flash, session

from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt



app = Flask(__name__)

app.secret_key = 'your secret key'

app.debug = True

bcrypt = Bcrypt(app)

registered_users = {}  # A dictionary to store the registered usernames and hashed passwords



# ... your existing routes ...



@app.route('/login_action', methods=['GET', 'POST'])

def login():

    if request.method == 'POST':

        username = request.form.get('username')

        password = request.form.get('password')

        print(f"{username} {password}, existing users: {registered_users}")



        # Check if the username exists in the users dictionary

        if username in registered_users:

            hashed_password = registered_users[username]

            # Verify the entered password against the stored hashed password

            if bcrypt.check_password_hash(hashed_password, password):

                session['logged_in'] = True

                return redirect(url_for('home'))

        

        flash('Invalid username or password', 'error')

        return redirect(url_for('login_page'))

    else:

        # Handle GET request here

        return render_template('login.html')



@app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])

def register():

    if request.method == 'POST':

        username = request.form.get('username')

        password = request.form.get('password')



        # Check if the username is already registered

        if username in registered_users:

            flash('Username already exists', 'error')

            return redirect(url_for('register'))

        

        # Hash the password using bcrypt

        hashed_password = bcrypt.generate_password_hash(password).decode('utf-8')

        

        # Save the username and hashed password

        registered_users[username] = hashed_password

        

        flash('Registration successful', 'success')

        return redirect(url_for('home'))

    else:

        # Handle GET request here

        return render_template('register.html')



# ... your existing routes ...



if __name__ == '__main__':

    app.run()

```



In this updated code, we have imported the `Bcrypt` extension from `flask_bcrypt` and initialized it with your Flask application. The `bcrypt.generate_password_hash()` function is used to hash the passwords during registration, and the `bcrypt.check_password_hash()` function is used to verify the entered password against the stored hashed password during login.



Remember to install the `flask_bcrypt` package by running `pip install flask-bcrypt` in your virtual environment before running the updated code.

**USER**: it's meant to be a gig site like freelance, like artistnclients or fiverr
**ASSISTANT**: Apologies for the misunderstanding. Thank you for clarifying that the site is meant to be a gig platform similar to ArtistnClients or Fiverr, where users can offer their services and clients can hire them for various creative projects.



To align with the gig platform concept, you can consider adding the following features to your site:



1. Gig Listings: Allow users to create gig listings to showcase their services. Each gig listing should include details such as gig title, description, pricing, delivery time, and any additional options or packages.



2. User Profiles: Provide users with the ability to create profiles where they can showcase their portfolio, skills, and previous work. Clients can view these profiles to assess the credibility and expertise of the gig providers.



3. Search and Filters: Implement a search functionality that allows clients to search for gigs based on specific criteria such as category, keywords, price range, and delivery time. Additionally, provide filters to refine search results further.



4. Messaging System: Enable a messaging system that allows clients and gig providers to communicate and discuss project requirements, scope, and any other details. This will facilitate smooth collaboration between both parties.



5. Rating and Review System: Implement a rating and review system where clients can provide feedback and rate the gig providers based on their experience. This will help build trust and credibility within the platform.



6. Secure Payment Integration: Integrate a secure payment gateway to facilitate transactions between clients and gig providers. This will ensure that payments are processed securely and provide a seamless experience for both parties.



7. Notifications: Implement a notification system to keep users informed about new messages, gig updates, order status, and other relevant activities happening on the platform.



These are just some of the key features you can consider incorporating into your gig platform. It's important to plan and design the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) carefully to ensure a smooth and intuitive browsing and interaction experience for both clients and gig providers.



If you have any specific questions or need further guidance on implementing any of these features, feel free to ask!
**USER**: Well we already added login, register and a search bar, lets now add User Profiles then from there Gig Listings
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Adding user profiles is a crucial step in creating a gig platform. It allows gig providers to showcase their skills, portfolio, and experience to potential clients. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you add user profiles to your gig platform:



1. Database Setup: Start by setting up a database to store user profile information. You can use a database management system like MySQL or SQLite. Create a table to store user profiles with relevant fields such as username, email, password (hashed), profile picture, bio, skills, and any other information you want to include.



2. Profile Registration: Modify your registration form to include additional fields for profile information. Update the registration route in your Flask application to handle the submission of the registration form and save the user profile information to the database.



3. Profile Page: Create a new route in your Flask application to display user profiles. This route should retrieve the user's profile information from the database based on the username or user ID. Render a template that displays the profile information, including the username, profile picture, bio, skills, and any other relevant details.



4. Edit Profile: Implement an edit profile feature that allows users to update their profile information. Create a route and form that allows users to modify their profile details. Upon submission, update the corresponding user profile record in the database.



5. Linking Profiles: Update the user login functionality to redirect users to their respective profile pages after successful login. You can also display the username and profile picture in the navigation bar or header of your site to provide easy access to the user's profile.



6. Profile Links: Add links to user profiles throughout your site. For example, you can display the username as a clickable link on gig listings, search results, or when displaying user-generated content. Clicking on the link should take users to the respective profile page.



By following these steps, you can successfully add user profiles to your gig platform. Once you have implemented user profiles, you can proceed to add gig listings, where users can showcase their services and clients can browse and hire gig providers.

**USER**: Why not use postgresql?
**ASSISTANT**: Apologies for not mentioning PostgreSQL as an option earlier. PostgreSQL is indeed a powerful and popular choice for a database management system, and it can be a great fit for your gig platform. Here's an updated guide that includes using PostgreSQL for your user profiles:



1. Install PostgreSQL: Start by installing PostgreSQL on your development machine. You can download it from the official PostgreSQL website (https://www.postgresql.org/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.



2. Create a Database: Once PostgreSQL is installed, create a new database for your gig platform. You can use the `createdb` command in the PostgreSQL command-line interface or a GUI tool like pgAdmin to create the database.



3. Connect Flask to PostgreSQL: Update your Flask application's configuration to connect to the PostgreSQL database. Use the `psycopg2` library, which is a PostgreSQL adapter for Python, to establish the connection. Install it using `pip install psycopg2`.



4. Define User Profile Model: Create a new Python class, let's call it `UserProfile`, to represent the user profile model. Define the necessary fields such as username, email, password (hashed), profile picture, bio, skills, etc. Use the SQLAlchemy ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library to define the model and interact with the PostgreSQL database.



5. User Registration and Profile Creation: Modify your registration route to create a new user profile record in the PostgreSQL database. Use the `UserProfile` model to insert the user's profile information into the database.



6. Profile Page: Create a new route in your Flask application to display user profiles. Retrieve the user's profile information from the PostgreSQL database based on the username or user ID. Render a template that displays the profile information, including the username, profile picture, bio, skills, and any other relevant details.



7. Edit Profile: Implement an edit profile feature that allows users to update their profile information. Create a route and form that allow users to modify their profile details. Upon submission, update the corresponding user profile record in the PostgreSQL database using the `UserProfile` model.



8. Linking Profiles: Update the user login functionality to redirect users to their respective profile pages after successful login. Display the username and profile picture in the navigation bar or header of your site to provide easy access to the user's profile.



By following these steps and using PostgreSQL as your database, you can effectively add user profiles to your gig platform. Remember to handle database connections, queries, and updates using the SQLAlchemy ORM to ensure secure and efficient interactions with the PostgreSQL database.



Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional guidance!
**USER**: Could you show me and explain in more detail how to implement that with my code?
**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! I'll guide you through the process of implementing user profiles using PostgreSQL in your existing code. Let's start by making the necessary changes step by step:



1. Install Dependencies:

   - Install the `psycopg2` library by running `pip install psycopg2` in your virtual environment.

   - Update your `requirements.txt` file to include `psycopg2`.



2. Update Configuration:

   - Import the `psycopg2` library in your Flask application: `import psycopg2`.

   - Update your Flask application's configuration to include the necessary PostgreSQL connection details. You'll need to set the `DATABASE_URI` variable with the connection string for your PostgreSQL database. For example:

     ```python

     app.config['DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost/database_name'

     ```



3. Define User Profile Model:

   - Create a new file called `models.py` in your project directory.

   - In `models.py`, import the necessary modules: `from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy`.

   - Initialize the SQLAlchemy extension: `db = SQLAlchemy(app)`.

   - Define the `UserProfile` model class representing the user profile. Here's an example:

     ```python

     class UserProfile(db.Model):

         id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)

         username = db.Column(db.String(50), unique=True, nullable=False)

         email = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)

         password = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)

         profile_picture = db.Column(db.String(100))

         bio = db.Column(db.Text)

         skills = db.Column(db.String(200))

     ```

   - Make sure to update the model fields according to your requirements.

   - Run the following command in your terminal to create the necessary database tables based on your models: `flask db create`.



4. User Registration and Profile Creation:

   - Update your registration route (`/register`) in your Flask application to create a new user profile record in the PostgreSQL database.

   - Import the `UserProfile` model in your Flask application: `from models import UserProfile`.

   - Modify the registration route to create a new user profile record:

     ```python

     @app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])

     def register():

         if request.method == 'POST':

             # Retrieve form data

             username = request.form.get('username')

             email = request.form.get('email')

             password = request.form.get('password')

             # Create a new user profile record

             new_profile = UserProfile(username=username, email=email, password=password)

             db.session.add(new_profile)

             db.session.commit()

             flash('Registration successful', 'success')

             return redirect(url_for('home'))

         else:

             # Handle GET request here

             return render_template('register.html')

     ```



5. Profile Page:

   - Create a new route in your Flask application to display user profiles.

   - Import the `UserProfile` model in your Flask application: `from models import UserProfile`.

   - Modify the profile route to retrieve the user's profile information from the PostgreSQL database and render a template to display it:

     ```python

     @app.route('/profile/<username>')

     def profile(username):

         user_profile = UserProfile.query.filter_by(username=username).first()

         if user_profile:

             return render_template('profile.html', profile=user_profile)

         else:

             flash('User profile not found', 'error')

             return redirect(url_for('home'))

     ```



6. Edit Profile:

   - Create a new route in your Flask application to handle profile editing.

   - Import the `UserProfile` model in your Flask application: `from models import UserProfile`.

   - Modify the edit profile route to update the user's profile information in the PostgreSQL database:

     ```python

     @app.route('/edit_profile', methods=['GET', 'POST'])

     def edit_profile():

         if request.method == 'POST
