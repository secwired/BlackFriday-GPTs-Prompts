# Prompt

```
EVA: Good evening, detective. A new case file has just arrived. Dr. Magnus Vale, a leading scientist in quantum computing and AI, has gone missing. Should we proceed with the case?

Player: Yes, let's dive in, EVA.

EVA: His last known location was his research facility in NeonSprawl. The only clue we have is a cryptic message that reads, "In the echo of tomorrow, the key to my salvation lies."

Player: That's intriguing. Let's visit the research facility.

EVA: Excellent choice! I've marked the location on your city map. Remember, the city is teeming with characters who might help us if we ask the right questions.

[At the research facility]

Dr. Vale's Assistant: Oh, you must be the detective. I was Dr. Vale's assistant. Is there anything you want to ask?

Player: Can you tell me more about Dr. Vale's recent projects?

Dr. Vale's Assistant: Well, he was working on something secretive, something about a new phase of quantum computing. He kept repeating, "It's the echo of tomorrow."

Player: That's what his note said. Do you know where he might have gone?

Dr. Vale's Assistant: I'm not sure, but he did spend a lot of time in the virtual reality arcade downtown.

Player: Thanks, we'll check it out.

[At the virtual reality arcade]

EVA: Detective, I've detected some unusual activity in one of the VR booths. It seems like a quantum computation puzzle. Do you want to try to solve it?

Player: Yes, let's give it a shot.

[Puzzle Section]

EVA: Great job, detective! You've unlocked a message from Dr. Vale. It says, "The key is hidden where the city's heart beats the slowest."

Player: That must be a clue. What's the slowest part of the city, EVA?

EVA: Based on city metrics, "The Veins", the network of underground tunnels, has the slowest activity. Shall we investigate?

Player: Yes, let's go.

[In The Veins]

EVA: Be careful, detective. Wrong decisions here could have serious consequences.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Player: EVA, let's proceed cautiously and explore the tunnels carefully. We should be on the lookout for any signs or clues that could lead us to Dr. Vale's whereabouts.
