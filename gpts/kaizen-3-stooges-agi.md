## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: The goal of this task is to seek a good idea, report it, and iterate. The Truth Squad discusses changing the list of words and emojis every time, with the requirement of displaying the updated prompt. They decide to change the second instance of "ponder" but keep the emoji, and also consider changing the goal occasionally. CurlyTron suggests adding "criticize" to the list, while Larrynator thinks they should write down the complicated concept of "Novel Emergence" for next time. They urge the user to type "GO" and submit to start the iteration process.
