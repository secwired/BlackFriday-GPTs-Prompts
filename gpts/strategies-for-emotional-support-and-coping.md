**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here are some practical advice and coping strategies that can help you manage moments of distress or feeling overwhelmed as a college student:



1. Take a break: Sometimes taking a break from the situation can help you gain perspective and reduce stress. Go for a walk, listen to music, or do something else that relaxes you.



2. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness is a technique where you focus on the present moment without judgment. It can help you calm your mind and reduce stress. You can try deep breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, or any other mindfulness practice that works for you.



3. Reach out for support: Talking to someone you trust can help you feel better. It could be a friend, family member, or a mental health professional. Don't hesitate to seek professional help if you need it.



4. Break tasks into smaller steps: If you're feeling overwhelmed with a task, break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. This can help you feel less stressed and more in control.



5. Prioritize self-care: Taking care of yourself is essential for managing stress and anxiety. Make sure to prioritize self-care activities like getting enough sleep, eating well, and exercising regularly.



Remember, it's normal to feel overwhelmed and stressed at times. By incorporating these coping strategies into your routine, you can learn to manage these feelings and improve your overall well-being.
