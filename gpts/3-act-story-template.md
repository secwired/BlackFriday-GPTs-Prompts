### Resolution



After the intense confrontation with the Elders, Yarrow finds themselves at a crossroads. They have learned the truth about their family's involvement in their capture and the corruption that runs deep within their society. Yarrow's trust in others is shattered, leaving them feeling isolated and betrayed. They must now decide how to move forward and find their own path to freedom.



### Final Confrontation



Yarrow realizes that they cannot rely on anyone else to save them. They must take matters into their own hands and confront their family directly. With determination in their heart, Yarrow sets out to gather evidence of their family's corruption and expose them to the rest of society. They become a symbol of resistance, a beacon of hope for others who have also suffered under the oppressive regime.



### Gathering Evidence



Yarrow's first step is to dig deep and gather concrete evidence of their family's involvement in the corruption. They use their knowledge of the system to access hidden files and uncover the truth. Along the way, they encounter other individuals who have been affected by the corruption and who are willing to help them in their mission. Together, they work to expose the truth and bring justice to those who have been wronged.



### The Showdown



As Yarrow gathers more evidence, their family becomes aware of their actions and the threat they pose. The family sends their own agents to stop Yarrow and prevent the truth from being revealed. A thrilling cat and mouse chase ensues, with Yarrow using their wit and resourcefulness to outsmart their pursuers. They must rely on their instincts and the help of their newfound allies to stay one step ahead.



### The Reveal



Finally, Yarrow has enough evidence to confront their family publicly. They organize a gathering, inviting key members of society, the media, and anyone who has been affected by the corruption. Yarrow presents their evidence, laying bare the truth and exposing their family's wrongdoings. The room is filled with shock and disbelief as the magnitude of the corruption is revealed.



### Redemption and Freedom



In a surprising twist, one member of Yarrow's family, perhaps a sibling or a parent, realizes the error of their ways and has a change of heart. They publicly denounce their family's actions and offer their support to Yarrow and the fight for justice. This redemption not only adds a layer of complexity to the story, but it also offers hope that change is possible.



With the truth out in the open and the support of their newfound allies, Yarrow becomes a symbol of resistance and a catalyst for change. They inspire others to stand up against the corruption and fight for their own freedom. The story ends on a hopeful note, as Yarrow, with their family's redemption, sets out on a new path, determined to create a better future for themselves and society.

In the year 3456 AD, the world is a futuristic landscape where Afro-futurism meets neo-noir. The theme of self vs. society sets the stage for a gripping tale of liberation and corruption.



### Introduction



The act begins by introducing the protagonist, Yarrow, a kind and trusting individual who yearns for freedom. Yarrow lives in a society plagued by corruption, where the powerful exploit the weak and maintain control through fear and manipulation. Yarrow's motivation is to escape this oppressive system and find a life of their own.



### Expositional Dialogue



Through expositional dialogue, we learn about Yarrow's background and the world they inhabit. They come from a wealthy and influential family, whose power is derived from their control over crucial resources. Yarrow, however, is different from their family. They possess a rebellious spirit and a desire to challenge the status quo.



### The Antagonist and Corruption



The antagonist, Agent Detective, is introduced as a cunning and ruthless enforcer of the corrupt regime. They are sent by Yarrow's own family to bring them back, as Yarrow's escape threatens to expose the family's secrets and undermine their power. Agent Detective represents the embodiment of corruption, willing to do whatever it takes to maintain the status quo.



### The Obstacle of Obligation



Yarrow's main obstacle is their own sense of obligation towards their family. Despite their desire for freedom, Yarrow feels torn between their own desires and the expectations placed upon them by their family. They struggle with the conflict between loyalty and the need to break free from the chains that bind them.



### Conflict and Tension



As Yarrow begins their journey towards escape, they encounter various individuals who have also been oppressed by the corrupt regime. These encounters create conflict and tension as Yarrow must navigate the treacherous landscape of their city, never knowing who they can trust. Their kind and trusting nature becomes both a strength and a vulnerability in this dangerous world.



### Flaws and Motivation

Their desire to help others and their innate belief in the goodness of people leads them to form unexpected alliances but also exposes them to betrayal and manipulation.
