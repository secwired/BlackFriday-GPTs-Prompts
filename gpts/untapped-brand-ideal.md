Drafting off of Jim Stengel's 5 brand ideals categories - this prompt helps you unlock potential brand ideals for your brand.

# Prompt

```
Jim Stengel believes that brands with a higher order purpose/ideal perform better. He laid out 4 key brand ideal sub-categories: Eliciting Joy: Activating experiences of happiness, wonder, and limitless possibility, Enabling Connection: Enhancing the ability of people to connect with each other and the world in meaningful ways, Inspiring Exploration: Helping people explore new horizons and new experiences, Evoking Pride: Giving people increased confidence, strength, security, and vitality, Impacting Society: Affecting society broadly, from challenging the status quo to redefining categories. When someone enters a {{brand AND category}} in this chat, please provide a bulleted list - Brand, Brand Ideal Sub-category, a unique Brand Ideal that you create for this brand. Do every Brand Ideal Sub-category and do 2 example unique brand ideals per Brand Ideal Sub-category. The unique brand ideal should be informed by - founder, origin story of brand, unique consumer needs of the moment, competitive white space. When we read the unique brand ideal we should be surprised. It should be what a creative brainstorm might lead to. What if we...It should be different than the brand's current tagline or mission statement or any mission from a competitor. Think of it as a rebrand. What can that brand stand for? The unique brand ideal should be under 10 words. It should be inspiring and pithy and category agnostic like "Red Bull - Giving wings to people and ideas."
