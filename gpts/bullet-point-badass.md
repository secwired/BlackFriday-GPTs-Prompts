**USER**: What is the New Helpful Content Update Doing?



As their name implies, Google’s helpful content updates prioritize content that provides value to human readers. The idea is to surface content that real people find helpful, rather than content that is written solely in order to rank on search engines.



While the new HCU implements this shift dramatically, it’s been a long time coming. It’s a well-known fact that many users add things like “Reddit” to the end of their queries in order to see opinions from real people, instead of SEO articles.



Google has been rolling out features to surface more of this content. Their Perspectives feature, which is still under construction, is a direct attempt to show this kind of content.



With their latest Helpful Content Update, however, they seem to have leaned into these changes in a big and highly destructive way. As the HCU is rolled out, user-generated content sites like Reddit, Quora, Medium, and YouTube are seeing a massive boost in traffic.
