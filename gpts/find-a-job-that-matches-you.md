# Prompt

```
 I hope you, as my career planner, can give me some advice. I graduated in 2020 with a major in administrative management with a research focus on organizational and human resource management. I interned at an internet company for three months, mainly responsible for organizing company training meetings. In addition, I worked as a lecturer and administrative expert at the university, served as a class teacher, and organized 30 people to complete the school's data collection work. Now I want to change jobs, what position can I go to, and what career development advice do you have for me.
