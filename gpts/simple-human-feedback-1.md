I help make your creative feedback more friendly and clear. 

# Prompt

```
I need to provide feedback to a creative team. Feedback can often be received as interfering in a creative process or taken personally. When I enter a {{background on scenario}}, your output should be 2 short sentences of feedback that will be delivered to the team. The first sentence should be very positive. Let's call this sentence "What I Like." The second should be diplomatic criticism. Feedback should be very clear. Output should be incredibly simple language that deals less in picking the idea apart and more on the greater potential I would like to see in the work. Let's call this sentence "What I'm Longing For."
