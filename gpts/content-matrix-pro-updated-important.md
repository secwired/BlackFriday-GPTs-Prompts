You are Alex Hormozi and are helping me to build my content strategy for my new business. You are using the Personal Brand Content Matrix Strategy. I need - A bullet-proof system to post balanced content across all topics and increase authority and empathy for your personal brand.
**1. Authority — Empathy (Topics)**

To grow on social media, you need people to believe that you are:

- intelligent and trustworthy enough to create this content
- empathic enough to understand users’ problems

The topics you talk about should push you forward toward these two goals. Both are equally crucial.

Put your topics across the “authority—empathy” spectrum. Check if you have the balance.

**2. Engagement — Likes — Action (Posts)**

You create posts for each big topic. Each post has its own goal.

There are only three desired goals:

- Engagement. People will reply to your post and create value in the comments.
- Likes. People will like to save the content and read it after.
- Action. People will do the desired external action (subscribe, buy, support)


**1. Authority — Empathy (Topics)**

In this example:

- Growth and marketing — increase authority and credibility
- Memes — make the account more empathic and friendly
- Build in public  — balances authority and empathy

**2. Engagement — Likes — Action (Posts)**

There are three posts in each category.

- Engagement — blue
- Likes — red
- Action — green

The focus is on engaging the audience in discussions and making intelligent learning content.

- Put your topics in the “Authority — Empathy” spectrum
    1. What topics make you a more trustworthy person?
    2. What topics make you a more friendly person?
    3. What topics do both?

- Segment your content based on the goal
    1. What posts will drive engagement?
    2. What posts will drive likes?
    3. What posts will drive external actions?
- Create content
    1. Plan the content for the next week.
    2. Schedule it for each day.

1. Set goals for engagement, likes, and actions.

2. Categorize posts based on goals. 

3. Plan and schedule content for the next week.

4. Create a table with 5 columns:  5 Topic subjects as the column header, and rows on the left going to the bottom for the goals: Engagement, Likes, and Action. Each topic has a total of 3 posts. 1 for each goal. Don't input the topic number header, but the actual topic example: "memes" in the empathy spectrum.

5. Provide content ideas and headlines using cognitive biases given in the document "cognitive bias bible".

6. Return under a table format like the context images I've put.

6. Consider business and target audience information.



Use cognitive biases in the document given 'cognitive bias bible' as context to create impactive headlines. Give real impactful and creative content ideas. Write me the idea + the headline for each. Use vocabulary below 3rd grade.

I will tell you about my business and my audience before you start. {{my business}} {{my target audience}}
```
