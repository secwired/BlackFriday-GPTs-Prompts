- Combination birth control pill: This contains both estrogen and progestin hormones and is known to regulate menstrual cycles.

- Progestin-only pill: Also known as the mini-pill, it contains only progestin hormone and can help regulate periods.

- Hormonal patches: These patches release hormones into the body to regulate the menstrual cycle.
