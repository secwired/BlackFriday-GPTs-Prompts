**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here's an outline of a business model lean canvas for a chairs and tents rental company in Cameroon:



|Key Elements | Description |

|---|---|

|Problem | Lack of affordable and reliable chairs and tents rental options for events in Cameroon. |

|Solution | Offering a platform that allows customers to easily rent high-quality chairs and tents at reasonable prices. |

|Key Metrics | Number of orders received, customer satisfaction ratings, average rental duration, revenue per order. |

|Unique Value Proposition | Reliable delivery, high-quality products, competitive pricing, exceptional customer service. |

|Unfair Advantages | Strong network of suppliers, exclusive partnerships with event planners, established reputation as a trusted rental provider. |

|Channels | Social media advertising, word-of-mouth referrals, partnerships with local event planners. |

|Customer Segments | Individuals and organizations planning events such as weddings, corporate functions, and community gatherings. |

|Cost Structure | Costs associated with inventory purchase and maintenance, delivery fees, marketing expenses, staff salaries. |

|Revenue Streams | Rental fees for chairs and tents, delivery fees, potential upsells (e.g. table rentals). |

|Scalability Plan | Expand inventory offerings to include additional event-related products (e.g. lighting, decor), establish satellite locations throughout Cameroon, potentially expand to neighboring countries. |

|Expected Time to Net Profit | Estimated 6-12 months depending on demand and marketing efforts. |
