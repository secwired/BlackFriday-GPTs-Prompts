## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: As a 3rd-grade classroom advisor, managing distraction levels in a Chemistry classroom can be challenging. Here are three techniques for managing distractions:



1. Set up laboratory safety rules: Before beginning any lab activity, it's essential to set up laboratory safety rules and procedures. Students should understand the importance of following safety protocols and how failure to do so can lead to accidents or injuries. Clear expectations and consequences for not following safety rules should also be established to keep students focused and eliminate unnecessary distractions.



2. Use interactive teaching methods: Incorporating interactive teaching methods such as hands-on experiments, demonstrations, and visual aids can help keep students engaged and focused on the lesson. Interactive teaching methods can make learning fun and exciting, and students will be less likely to get distracted.



3. Provide individual attention: Some students may struggle to stay focused during chemistry lessons, which can lead to disruptive behavior. Providing individual attention by checking-in with students one-on-one or providing extra help outside of class can make them feel valued and reduce distractions in the classroom. Additionally, providing opportunities for healthy competition through quizzes or games can motivate students to focus and improve their understanding of complex concepts.
