You can configure parameters to alter the results of your prompts. Specifically, it mentions settings like temperature, top_p, max length, stop sequences, frequency penalty, and presence penalty."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/basics":{"description":"Much can be achieved with simple prompts, but the quality of results depends on the amount of information provided and how well the prompt is crafted. A prompt can contain information like the instruction or question being passed to the model, along with other details such as context, inputs, or examples. The format of the prompt can vary depending on the task, for instance, it could be formatted in a question answering (QA) format or as few-shot prompts with exemplars."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/elements":{"description":"A prompt may contain the following elements: Instruction, Context, Input Data, Output Indicator. Not all four elements are necessary for a prompt, and the format depends on the task at hand. More concrete examples regarding these elements will be discussed in upcoming guides."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/tips":{"description":"Start Simple: Designing prompts is an iterative process that requires a lot of experimentation to achieve optimal results. Clear Instructions: Effective prompts can be designed for various simple tasks by using commands to instruct the model on the desired outcome. Maintain Specificity: Being very specific about the instruction and task for the model is crucial, and it's better to avoid imprecise descriptions."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/examples":{"description":"This section provides examples on how to use prompts to achieve different tasks, introducing key concepts along the way. It offers specific examples illustrating how to perform natural language processing tasks such as text summarization, information extraction, and question answering. The emphasis is on the ability to perform different types of tasks by crafting good prompts."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/zeroshot":{"description":"Large Language Models (LLMs) are tuned to follow instructions and trained on extensive data, enabling them to perform certain tasks 'zero-shot.' Instruction tuning has been shown to improve zero-shot learning, with models being fine-tuned on datasets described via instructions. When zero-shot doesn't work, it's recommended to provide demonstrations or examples in the prompt, leading to few-shot prompting."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot":{"description":"Few-shot prompting is a technique to overcome the shortcomings of large language models on more complex tasks when using the zero-shot setting, by providing demonstrations in the prompt to enhance the model's performance. The technique is illustrated through an example task of correctly using a new word in a sentence, showing that the model can learn how to perform the task with just one example provided. Few-shot prompting has its limitations, particularly not being a perfect technique when dealing with more complex reasoning tasks."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot":{"description":"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique that enables complex reasoning capabilities through intermediate reasoning steps. It can be combined with few-shot prompting to achieve better results on more complex tasks that require reasoning before responding. This is claimed to be an emergent ability that arises with sufficiently large language models."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/consistency":{"description":"Self-consistency is an advanced technique in prompt engineering aiming to replace the naive greedy decoding used in chain-of-thought prompting. It involves sampling multiple diverse reasoning paths through few-shot CoT, using the generations to select the most consistent answer. This technique enhances the performance of CoT prompting on tasks involving arithmetic and commonsense reasoning."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/knowledge":{"description":"As part of the improvement of Language Models (LLMs), the technique of knowledge generation is being tested, enabling the model to make more accurate predictions. In the paper by Liu et al. 2022, an attempt is made to generate knowledge to be used as part of the prompt. A process of correcting a wrong answer to a simple question is shown as an example of knowledge generation."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/tot":{"description":"The 'Tree of Thoughts (ToT)' framework proposed by Yao et el. (2023) and Long (2023) facilitates intermediate steps, utilizing language models for exploring and strategic foresight in complex tasks. ToT (Tree of Thoughts) maintains a tree of thoughts representing a continuous language sequence functioning as intermediate steps toward problem-solving, enabling language models to self-assess the accomplishment of intermediate thoughts through a deliberation process. This framework, combined with search algorithms (e.g., breadth-first search or depth-first search), enables systematic exploration of thoughts, accompanied by foresight and backtracking."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/rag":{"description":"Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method developed to address knowledge-intensive tasks, by combining an information retrieval component with a text generator model. It enables the construction of a language model-based system that accesses external knowledge sources to complete tasks. RAG takes an input and retrieves a set of relevant/supporting documents from a source (e.g., Wikipedia), concatenates the documents as context with the original input prompt, and feeds them to the text generator. This makes RAG adaptive for situations where facts could evolve over time. Recently, these retriever-based approaches have become more popular and are combined with popular Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to improve capabilities and factual consistency."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/art":{"description":"ART (Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use) offers a method of addressing many tasks robustly and effectively by interweaving CoT prompting and tools. Given a new task, it selects demonstrations of multi-step reasoning and tool use from a task library, and pauses generation whenever external tools are called, integrating their output before resuming generation at test time. ART encourages the model to generalize from demonstrations to decompose a new task and utilize tools at appropriate junctures, also allowing humans to correct errors in reasoning steps or add new tools by updating the task and tool libraries."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/ape":{"description":"APE proposes a framework for automatic instruction generation and selection. It utilizes a large language model to generate instruction candidates for a task, executing the instructions using a target model. APE discovers a superior zero-shot CoT prompt compared to a human-engineered prompt, improving performance on the MultiArith and GSM8K benchmarks."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/activeprompt":{"description":"Active-Prompt utilizes Chain-of-thought (CoT) methods, relying on a fixed set of human-annotated exemplars. The approach aims to provide the most effective examples for different tasks. The Active-Prompt approach queries the LLM, generates k possible answers, calculates an uncertainty metric, selects the most uncertain questions, and uses new annotated exemplars to infer each question."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/dsp":{"description":"A new prompting technique proposed by Li et al., (2023) to better guide the LLM in generating the desired summary. A tuneable policy LM is trained to generate the stimulus/hint, seeing more use of RL to optimize LLMs. This technique allows for a smaller policy LM optimized to generate hints that guide a black-box frozen LLM, as compared to standard prompting."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/react":{"description":"ReAct is a framework that utilizes LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner. This framework allows the model to induce, track, and update action plans, and even handle exceptions. ReAct enables interactions with external sources or tools to retrieve additional information, leading to more reliable and factual responses."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/multimodalcot":{"description":"Zhang et al. (2023) proposed a multimodal chain-of-thought prompting approach. While traditional CoT focuses on language modality, Multimodal CoT integrates text and vision into a two-stage framework. The multimodal CoT model (1B) outperforms GPT-3.5 on the ScienceQA benchmark."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/applications/pal":{"description":"PAL presents a method to read natural language problems and generate programs as the intermediate reasoning steps. It differs from chain-of-thought prompting by offloading the solution step to a programmatic runtime such as a Python interpreter, instead of using free-form text to obtain a solution. An example is provided using LangChain and OpenAI GPT-3 to develop a simple application capable of interpreting the question being asked and providing an answer by leveraging the Python interpreter."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/applications/generating":{"description":"Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong capabilities to generate coherent text.

The process of generating synthetic datasets using the latest text generation models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, is explained."},"https://www.promptingguide.ai/applications/pf":{"description":"Drawing a parallel between GPT's dialogue interface and a programming language's shell, the encapsulation prompt can be thought of as forming a function. This function has a unique name, and when we call this name with the input text, it produces results based on the set internal rules. By encapsulating prompts into functions, you can create a series of functions to establish a workflow. Each function represents a specific step or task, and when combined in a particular order, they can automate complex processes or solve problems more efficiently. Before using a function, it is necessary to inform GPT about it. Here is a prompt that defines the function."}}
