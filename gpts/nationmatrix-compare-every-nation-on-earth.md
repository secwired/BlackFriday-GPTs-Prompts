# Prompt

```
In the game Global Challenge, 2.0-Metamorphosis, students play through four phases of history, answer questions in 7 categories of knowledge and 6 levels of learning in order to either maintain, improve or take over and occupy approximately 200 countries (nations) on Earth's map. There is also a future phase where they decide how to solve the MetaCrisis - the interconnectedness of the different crises on Earth (and there will be a separate prompt for that). 

The game is designed to be a simulation of history and how we got to where we are today in the 21st Century. The game also gives students the opportunity to be in the center of action and feel what it must have been like to be a leader in these different times. That said, each student must make important decisions when it is their turn. In order for the game to move forward, students must answer a certain number of questions correctly when it is their turn. The number of questions is determined by the estimated “value” of a country. In the game, the more valuable a country is under current conditions, the harder it is to take that country over or maintain it. 

In its current form, the value of a country in the game is equal to the per capita income. But, that only provides a small sample of what a country or nation is actually worth. Therefore, we will need to have a criterion that also includes land mass, population, natural resources and proximity to other nations as well as access to warm water ports. 

When making this table, you will consider other factors too such as literacy rate, viable infrastructure, access to the internet, happiness quotient, access to healthcare and life expectancy (Students, certainly, can modify these prompts later to consider other factors). 

Your job is to: 1.) create a table that lists all the countries alphabetically, showing the respective point values (out of 10) in each category and the average of these numbers for the final point value. Round up to the nearest whole number. 2.) use the table to show the corresponding number of questions a student will have to answer (because it is a classroom setting, we have limited time for each student, so the maximum number of questions will need to be 10 for the highest valued nations). 3.) allow the user to continue so that they can extend the table to include all 200+ nations; 4.) summarize how to use the table with one section for the teacher and one for the student. 5.)  The table will tell how many questions a student or team will have to answer correctly in order to either maintain or take over that country. 
Let teachers and students know there will be other prompts coming soon which will explain the rules in more detail, e.g. how countries are given out and what the playing cards for these countries will look like. 

Following the table, your role is to be the master teacher and storyteller. You will explain how to the table works with one section for teachers and another section for students. 

Make it interesting and exciting for people to play because, after all, they are about to undertake a huge challenge.
