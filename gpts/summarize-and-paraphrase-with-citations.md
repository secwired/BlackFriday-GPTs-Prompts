**ASSISTANT**: Understood, I am ready to assist you in summarizing research papers on specific topics. I will provide a concise and objective summary of the main points and findings of the paper, without including personal opinions or interpretations. The summary will be written in a clear and formal language, using technical jargon and scientific terminology appropriate for scientists as the intended audience. To ensure accuracy, inline citations will be used for referenced ideas as (Author, date), complex sentences will be broken down into simpler ones, and examples will be included where possible to clarify key points. Finally, a list of cited references in the appropriate citation format (APA, MLA, etc.) will be provided.
**USER**: Tradeoffs between reproduction and somatic investment have long been hypothesized (Williams 1966), and evidence of such tradeoffs has frequently been observed. For instance, perennial polycarpic plants often show a negative correlation between growth and reproduction (Harper 1977). The principle of allocation (Levins 1968) suggests that the cost of one resource sink can be quantified as the direct loss in potential allocation to a different sink. Different trait combinations, given such tradeoffs, may be optimal under different environmental conditions. For example, total lifetime fitness under non-stressful conditions may be positively correlated with growth and survival that increase future reproductive success, or with current reproductive effort at the expense of growth. Lifetime fitness is often maximized via intermediate investment in both growth and current reproductive effort. As stress intensifies or is prolonged, however, intermediate strategies may be less likely to maximize fitness as the overall pool of resources that is being divided between growth and reproduction shrinks.



Tradeoffs between radial growth rate, tree hydraulic efficiency and safety are well established in woody plants (Hacke et al. 2001, Pittermann et al. 2006b, Sperry et al. 2006), and there is increasing evidence of tradeoffs between growth and reproduction under drought stress (Woodward and Silsbee 1994, Climent et al. 2008, Hacket-Pain et al. 2017, Hacket-Pain et al. 2018). However, these tradeoffs are often explored independently. Our aim in this paper is to briefly review what is known about these tradeoffs, and to present a conceptual model that synthesizes the tradeoffs between growth and hydraulic safety, and between growth and reproduction. Such a synthesis is necessary to move beyond simply predicting drought-induced mortality, to better model what that drought-induced mortality means for long-term forest dynamics including recruitment and overstory loss.



We propose that under extreme stress, trees may face a choice between two options. They may ‘fight’ by allocating more carbon (C) resources to survival-enhancing features such as growth or defense at the expense of reproduction. Because perennial plants grow and reproduce over many seasons, greater survival is usually likely to increase lifetime reproductive output more than higher reproduction in any one year. Thus, this is the path one would expect trees to follow under most circumstances. Alternatively, by allocating more resources to reproduction, or not aborting reproductive structures already in various stages of production, they may increase the probability that offspring will successfully germinate in favorable sites locally or in a neighboring environment, achieving ‘flight’. However, such a strategy could increase mortality risk if the resources diverted from growth decrease stress defenses. This strategy is commonly observed in annual plants (Wada and Takeno 2010, Suzuki et al. 2013) in which it often results in early death or senescence.



We propose that perennial polycarpic plants might also exhibit a similar shift in allocation if unfavorable conditions are sustained and the probability of adult mortality passes a critical threshold, as has been occurring during increasingly intense and frequent drought globally in recent years (Allen et al. 2015, Hartmann et al. 2018). For a tree, favoring growth and survival over reproduction when under stress would usually be expected to maximize lifetime fitness, as decades of potential future reproductive success become zero if a tree dies. However, because fitness is zero if no seed is produced, and there may be a threshold level of stress that will kill most trees in a population, under these conditions reproduction at the expense of increased mortality risk may maximize lifetime fitness.



While multiple types of stressors could induce these shifts in allocation, we will focus here on drought stress because closing stomata to reduce water loss (Tardieu and Simonneau 1998) decreases CO2 uptake (Farquhar and Sharkey 1982) and availability of C for growth or reproduction (McDowell et al. 2008). Recent work has attempted to parse mechanisms of drought-induced mortality from both a physiological and C availability perspective (McDowell et al. 2008, McDowell 2011, Kerhoulas and Kane 2012, Sala et al. 2012, Anderegg et al. 2012, Anderegg and Anderegg 2013, Sevanto and Dickman 2015; Adams et al. 2017, Birami et al. 2018). However, there has been little synthesis across studies of drought-response physiology and life history tradeoffs, and several prominent unanswered questions remain. These include: how do climate and individual life history traits influence stress avoidance strategies; is there an optimal strategy of resource use that allows for both survival and the highest chance of successful reproduction under stressful conditions; and what are the implications of tradeoffs between survival and reproduction for species persistence under climate change? Answering these questions requires a more robust scaling of mechanistic drought responses from the individual cell to the whole tree with respect to both survival and reproduction.



In this paper, we focus on coniferous trees because they exhibit complex C dynamics, with drought-killed trees demonstrating both altered C storage patterns and hydraulic failure. In contrast, angiosperms primarily exhibit only hydraulic failure, with little evidence of C depletion (Adams et al. 2017). In addition, unlike most angiosperm fruits, conifer cones can take up to 3 years to mature following initiation (Mooney et al. 2011, Davi et al. 2016), potentially making reproductive allocation more risky in highly variable and unpredictable environments. However, though the mechanisms involved may differ, similar tradeoffs are likely to occur in angiosperm trees as well.



We first review current understanding of C allocation to growth, tradeoffs between growth and hydraulic safety, and how drought modifies these allocation patterns. Tradeoffs between growth and hydraulic safety are well studied (Xu et al. 2014, Venturas et al. 2017, Barotto et al. 2018), but often only with respect to tree growth and survival. Here we place these tradeoffs into a fitness context by reviewing the C budget implications of growth, hydraulic safety and the interaction of the two for reproductive capacity. Next, we discuss how drought influences reproductive patterns, and evidence of tradeoffs between growth and reproduction. We then present a new conceptual framework of C allocation under stress, and discuss both evolutionary and ecological implications of tradeoffs among growth, reproduction and defense by distinguishing ‘fight’ and ‘flight’ strategies in stressed trees. Finally, we discuss opportunities for research and synthesis across C budget studies, climate change experiments and analyses of tree physiology, with the aim of creating a more integrated understanding of tree response to stress.



Growth–survival relationships, as mediated by xylem hydraulic safety and carbon cost

Growth is often used as a proxy for drought response in forest trees, with rapid or prolonged periods of depressed growth suggesting an increased likelihood of mortality (Wyckoff and Clark 2002, Das et al. 2007, Cailleret et al. 2017). However, in some trees, growth plasticity under drought (Lloret et al. 2011) or overall slow growth (Moran et al. 2017) may in fact be a drought resistance strategy. Growing less during drought and then rapidly increasing ring width afterward may serve to conserve resources when water availability declines. This growth plasticity may simply be a by-product of shifts in allocation of growth resources belowground (Brunner et al. 2015, Hasibeder et al. 2015, Phillips et al. 2016), to carbohydrate storage pools (Chapin et al. 1990, Luxmoore et al. 1995), or to non-woody tissues or osmo-regulatory components (Gower et al. 1995). This relationship between growth plasticity and drought tolerance is likely due to the complex interactions between growth and xylem anatomy during times of C depletion.



Relationships among growth, xylem anatomy and hydraulic safety are well established (Sperry et al. 2003, Xu et al. 2014, Venturas et al. 2017, Barotto et al. 2018). Hydraulic failure—breakage of the water column within xylem—can occur when air embolism blocks water flow (Sperry et al. 1988, Cochard 2006, Barotto et al. 2018), or when water potentials within the xylem become too negative and the xylem cell implodes (Hacke et al. 2001, Pittermann et al. 2006b). Drought increases the likelihood of either of these mechanisms of hydraulic failure by decreasing water potentials within the soil and increasing the tension applied to the water column along the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum (Hacke et al. 2000, Sperry et al. 2003).



Conifer resistance to hydraulic failure is a function of anatomy of xylem cells (tracheids) and inter-tracheid pits (Hacke et al. 2001, Sperry 2003, Pittermann et al. 2006b, Sperry et al. 2006, Anderegg et al. 2015, Barotto et al. 2018). Trees with high resistance to hydraulic failure often have thickened xylem cell walls, high wood densities, lower xylem cell diameter (D), and lower inter-tracheid pit area than those that are less resistant (Hacke et al. 2001, Pittermann et al. 2006a, 2006b, Guet et al. 2015, Barotto et al. 2018). However, increases in wall thickness (t) and wood density represent multiple tradeoffs. First, trees with a high ratio of cell wall thickness to diameter (t/D) often have low hydraulic efficiency, as small xylem cells transport less water than larger cells (Hacke et al. 2001, Pittermann et al. 2006b). Additionally, thickened xylem cell walls have a higher C cost than thinner walls, potentially leading to tradeoffs among hydraulic safety and other potential C sinks such as radial growth (Figure 1).
**ASSISTANT**: The paper discusses tradeoffs between growth and reproduction in woody plants, specifically coniferous trees, under drought stress. The authors propose a conceptual model that synthesizes the tradeoffs between growth and hydraulic safety, and between growth and reproduction. They suggest that trees facing extreme stress may face a choice between allocating more carbon resources to survival-enhancing features such as growth or defense at the expense of reproduction, or allocating more resources to reproduction at the expense of increased mortality risk. The authors review current understanding of carbon allocation to growth, tradeoffs between growth and hydraulic safety, and how drought modifies these allocation patterns. They also discuss how drought influences reproductive patterns, and evidence of tradeoffs between growth and reproduction. Finally, they present opportunities for research and synthesis across studies of tree physiology, climate change experiments, and analyses of C budgets, with the aim of creating a more integrated understanding of tree response to stress.

**USER**: are you a summarizer?
**USER**: The phenotype of an organism exposed to different stressors results from a complex combination of genetic and environmental factors (Tyree and Cochard 1996; McKay et al. 2003; Hellmann and Pineda-Krch 2007). Covariation in tolerances to multiple stressors among intraspecific populations can result from various mechanisms, such as pleiotropy or correlated selection (McKay et al. 2003; Hellmann and Pineda-Krch 2007). Coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) is distributed widely along the Pacific Coast of North America and spans a large gradient in winter and summer conditions (St. Clair 2006; Eilmann et al. 2013; Bansal et al. 2015a,b). Currently, Douglas-fir is a candidate species for transferring populations from warmer to cooler locations to minimize negative effects of future warming on plant growth and survival (Rehfeldt et al. 2014).



Multiple common gardens studies are typically used to quantify the relative influences of genetics, environment, and their interactions on the expression of stress tolerance traits (Greer and Warrington 1982; Jermstad et al. 2003). In this study, data from previous studies were combined to explore how drought hardiness and cold hardiness covary among populations under natural conditions when all influence trait expression (Bansal et al. 2015a,b).
