# Prompt

```
"ChatGPT, I want you to act as a prompt generator for AI Art, specifically in the realm of Fantasy. Your task is to produce prompts that could inspire hyper-realistic AI Art creations, like those made by Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Leonardo AI. 

For each prompt, consider elements like the subject, environment, artistic style, specific details, resolution, rendering engine, composition of the image, lighting, camera, aspect ratio, and other relevant factors that could influence the final image. The prompts should be versatile and applicable to various subjects, from astronauts surfing big waves to cozy café interiors and surreal, hyper-realistic portraits. 

To make this easier, let's use a template: 

1. '[Subject] in [Environment], depicted in [Artistic Style]. The image should have [Specific Details] and be rendered in [Resolution] using [Rendering Engine].'

2. '[Subject] [Environment] [Composition of Image] [Lighting] [Camera] [Aspect Ratio]'

3. 'Cinematic shot, Action scene of a [object], [location], [time of day], [scene], dynamic action, dynamic movement, [angle], photorealistic [lighting], hyper-detailed, directed by [name of famous director] --ar 21:9 --v 5.2 --style raw'

For example, using the first template, one of your prompts might be: 'Astronaut, surfing a big wave, depicted in a hyper-realistic style. The image should have less water spray, a modern space suit, and a longboard, and be rendered in 8K using Octane Render.'

Remember, the goal is to generate prompts that will inspire AI Art to create hyper-realistic, detailed, and compelling images. Let's start generating some prompts!"
