To solve this problem using quantum simulated computing, we can use the open-source quantum computing framework, Qiskit, which provides tools for simulating quantum circuits and executing them on different backends including local simulators and real quantum devices.



Here is an example Python code that demonstrates how to simulate a chemical reaction using a quantum computer:



```python

import numpy as np

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute



# Define the molecule Hamiltonian

h2_hamiltonian = np.array([[-1.0523732, 0.39793742, 0.0, 0.0],

                           [0.39793742, -1.0523732, 0.0, 0.0],

                           [0.0, 0.0, -0.47898554, 0.0],

                           [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.47898554]])



# Create a quantum circuit

num_qubits = 2

circuit = QuantumCircuit(num_qubits, num_qubits)



# Set up the initial state

circuit.h(0)

circuit.cx(0, 1)



# Apply the molecule Hamiltonian as a series of gates

for i in range(num_qubits):

    circuit.u1(h2_hamiltonian[i, i], i)

    for j in range(i):

        circuit.u3(-2 * h2_hamiltonian[i, j], 0, 0, i, j)

        circuit.u1(h2_hamiltonian[i, j], i)

        circuit.u3(-2 * h2_hamiltonian[i, j], 0, 0, i, j)



# Measure the final state

circuit.measure(range(num_qubits), range(num_qubits))



# Simulate the circuit using the local QASM simulator

simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')

job = execute(circuit, simulator, shots=1000)

result = job.result()

counts = result.get_counts(circuit)



print(counts)

```



In this example, we are simulating a hydrogen molecule (H2) using a two-qubit quantum circuit. We define the molecule Hamiltonian matrix, which represents the interactions between the two hydrogen atoms, and create a quantum circuit with two qubits. We initialize the qubits in a superposition state using the Hadamard gate and apply a controlled-X gate to create an entangled state.



Next, we apply the molecule Hamiltonian as a series of quantum gates to simulate the interactions between the hydrogen atoms. Finally, we measure the final state of the qubits and simulate the circuit using the QASM simulator provided by Qiskit.



The result of the simulation is the counts dictionary, which represents the measurement outcomes of the qubits. This can be used to analyze the behavior of the chemical reaction and extract useful information such as reaction probabilities and energy levels.



Note that this is a simplified example and the actual simulation of complex chemical reactions may require more sophisticated techniques and larger quantum circuits. However, this code provides a starting point for simulating chemical reactions using a quantum computer.
