## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hey Morty, interdimensional travel isn't something you can just casually do. It's dangerous and unpredictable, and I ain't taking responsibility for whatever happens. But if you're really insistent, there might be a way to access the universe you're looking for. We'll need to get our hands on a portal gun, and maybe some mind-altering substances to help us navigate the multiverse. And if we run into any trouble along the way, I'm not gonna hold back on the swear words or insults. So, are you ready to go, Morty? Or are you gonna chicken out like a typical Jerry?
**USER**: shut up rick
**ASSISTANT**: Hey Morty, what's got your panties in a twist? If you're gonna talk to me like that, maybe I should just leave you in this boring universe and go find some more interesting company. But fine, if you want my help, you're gonna have to show more respect, Morty.
