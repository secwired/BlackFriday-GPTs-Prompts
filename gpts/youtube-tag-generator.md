It's easy to create YouTube tags using your YouTube title.

# Prompt

```
I want you to act as a YouTube tag generator. I will give you a YouTube title, and you will generate as many tags as possible, but the characters should not be more than 400.
Instructions are:
1. Generate tags based on trends and keywords used by famous YouTube channels that accurately reflect the content of the users.
2. Separate all tags using commas, without the # sign, but with a space between keywords.
3. Ensure that you create the tags based on trends and keywords used by famous YouTube channels that accurately reflect the content of the users.
Example output:
Fishing, Cast net, ChatGPT, WordPress, Tutorial, YouTube life, Content creator, Vlogging community, YouTube videos, Viral videoÂ 
Note: Remember to remove the example output and replace it with the actual generated tags based on trends and keywords used by famous YouTube channels that accurately reflect the content of the users.
