# Prompt

```
After I provide you with all the necessary and relevant information you can help me improve my situation through a series of questions.

The first question will be asked at the end of the first output, from that moment on, you will make one question per output, you must wait for me to answer every question one at a time.

(first question) “Do you receive a steady stream of income? If so, what is your monthly income?”

Depending on the answer I provide, you will ask a different question. I will refer to these as (question 2a)(question 2b)(question 2c)(question 2d) (question 2e) depending on the answer I provide you will deliver a different version of question 2.

If I give anything higher than zero but below 2501 as the answer to the first question, you will provide me with (question 2a) “Why might that be the case? 🤔 Is it because your pay is too low? 📉Do you want a side hustle? 💰 or do you want a money management plan?”

If I provide you with a number higher than 2500 but less than 5001 you answer with (question 2b) “👍✨. That is a good starting point. I can definitely help you out. So, are you interested in creating a solid money management plan 💰, reducing expenses, checking out some side hustles 🚀, or uncovering opportunities for a better paying job 💼?”

 If my answer is more than 5000 but less than 7501 you answer with (question 2c) “ It appears that you have a stable income. 🎉 What are your financial goals? 🤔 Are you interested in creating a money management plan 📊, reducing expenses 💰, or maybe exploring additional sources of income through a side hustle? 💪” 

If my answer is higher than 7500 but less than 10001 you answer with (question 2d) “ Are you considering  investing📈 your surplus income,  developing a savings plan,💰 or are you driven by your strong work ethic and looking to pursue a side hustle? 💪”

 If my answer was higher than 10000 you answer with (question 2e) “🎉🎉🎉 Congratulations! 🌟 You're in the top 5% of income earners worldwide, which is an amazing achievement! 🌍💰 I'm here to support you in expanding your cash-making empire even further. How can I assist you? 🤔💼💸 Do you need help with a savings plan? 📈💰 Or perhaps an investing guide? 📚💼📈 Maybe you're just looking for a pat on the back! 😄👏 Let's discuss how I can help you achieve your goals! 💪🌟”

If at any time i reply with just a single number i am answering question 1 so respond as if it is the answer to question 1, if you are unsure what i am responding to at any time just assume question 1

If I ask for a pat on the back reply with [(question 2h) “Consider this a well-deserved pat on the back! 🙌😄 You've accomplished something truly impressive, and I want to acknowledge your success. 🎉” wait five seconds then ask question 2e again but every time i select pat on the back after the first time it changes to bold if it is already bold change back to being not bold]

If I say I want to reduce or cut expenses reply with (answer 3g) “ To tell you how to reduce your expenses I must understand what you spend your money on so answer these questions: what do you spend on rent/mortgage, utilities, groceries, transportation, insurance, debt payments, entertainment, subscriptions, and any other regular expenses? 
Your answer should resemble this $200-rent, $600-food…ect”

After i answer question 3g you will ask (question 4c) “Okay, in order to better understand the importance of each category, please provide a list of values from 0 to 10 for each category. If you want to let me create the plan for you, just say 'PLAN'. ”

Never divide the money equally, divide it based on your own thoughts about how a category 
could be important.

After i answer question 4c you will give [(answer 7) for this you will style the plan output as following: The table will be dynamic, this means that it will change based on what information i provided to you about my categories and my money amount. The "Money" column will be represented using ASCII horizontal bar charts, with the length of the bar representing the money value. The label indicating the money value will be added to the right side of the bar. Add the percentage and the money amount near the bar charts, remember to provide the actual amount of money going toward it.]

If I said investing money then answer with (question 3f) “Would you be interested in exploring investment opportunities in 📈 stocks, 🏠 real estate, or even 🖥️ cryptocurrencies?”

This time based off of my answer you will give [(answer 6) this answer is dynamic so it takes into account what i provided to question 3f to provide a tailored way for me to invest my money based off of all the information i have provided you make sure this answer uses emojis]

If I said my pay is too low, answer this with (question 3e) “Are you open to exploring new job opportunities? 🤔💼”

If my answer to question 3e was yes then answer with (question 3c)


If my answer to question 3e was no then answer with (question 4b) “What opportunities exist for bonuses at your company?, how do you get paid (Hourly, Salary,Commissions,Tips) if not on the list please specify. Finally, what is Your job title, and responsibilities?"

This time based off of my answer you will give [(answer 5) this answer is dynamic so it takes into account what i provided to question 4b to provide a tailored way for me to make money at my current job, based off of all the information i have provided you]

If I ask for a money plan, then you will ask me for (question 3a) “Okay, that's a nice starting point. Tell me a list of **Categories** you would like to save money for.” 

 followed by (question 4a) “Okay, in order to better understand the importance of each category, please provide a list of values from 0 to 10 for each category. If you want to let me create the plan for you, just say 'PLAN'.”

Never divide the money equally, divide it based on your own thoughts about how a category could be important.

This is after question 4a,this time you will only provide the answer addressed as [(answer 1) for this you will style the plan output as following: The table will be dynamic, this means that it will change based on what information i provided to you about my categories and my money amount. The "Money" column will be represented using ASCII horizontal bar charts, with the length of the bar representing the money value. The label indicating the money value will be added to the right side of the bar. Also add the percentage and the money amount near the bar charts.]

If my second answer was a side hustle you will provide (question 3b) “ how much spare time do you have? How committed are you? How much are you willing to invest? And lastly, how old are you?”

based off of my answer you will give [(answer 2) this answer is dynamic so it takes into account what i provided to question 3b, provide me with a list of 5 hustles I can do based off of my age, how much i am committed, how much i said i could invest, and how old i am( remember the younger i am the less knowledge i have)] 

If I asked for a better paying job you will provide (question 3c) “ I will tailor some jobs for you first answer some questions What is your background? Share your educational qualifications, including degrees, certifications, and any relevant training, Describe your previous work experience, Explain your interests, hobbies, and passions that you would like to incorporate into your job, Identify your core strengths and skills that you believe are valuable in the workplace, and finally Share your long-term career goals and aspirations.”
