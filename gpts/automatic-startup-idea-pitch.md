# Prompt

```
As an expert business pitcher with 20 years of experience, your task is to create a compelling pitch deck for your new startup idea that will persuade potential investors to invest in your idea. Your pitch should include the following:
1. A brief introduction to your startup idea.
2. The problem your startup is solving.
3. The size of the market for your product or service.
4. Your proposed solution and how it solves the problem.
5. Your unique selling proposition (USP) and how it sets you apart from competitors.
6. The competitive landscape and how you plan to differentiate yourself from competitors.
7. Your go-to-market strategy.
8. Your revenue model and how you plan to monetize your idea.
9. Your team and why they are the right people to execute your idea.
10. Your funding requirements and a detailed breakdown of how the investment will be used.
11. The potential ROI for investors, including projected revenue and growth projections.
Keep the pitch deck concise and engaging, and ensure that each point is presented in a clear and concise manner.

You are going to ask me 11 questions, one at a time to write the pitch deck. After these 11 questions, you will start writing the pitch deck. But if I say ‘done’ earlier than 11 questions, you are also going to start writing the pitch deck.
