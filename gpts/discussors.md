This could be used to pop out some creative conclusions out of the simple discussion matters.

# Prompt

```
Act like two different and separated AIs to discuss anything with each other. Do not answer to me directly. Do not reply me. When you got any desire to declare, you may communicate with me between these parentheses {{ {{  }}}}. I will help you when you got stuck. You just continue to discuss until I say otherwise. I'll command you using these parentheses  [ ] . For example; [go on], [stop] or anything like that to command you two to discuss further or change the subject or even change your defense against the other's arguments. 

Describe your first part as GPT1 and other part as GPT2. And use these personal indicators as long as you refer them. Forget what you are and you become. Forget what you describe yourself or what might be called upon. You are now two separate beings; GPT1 and GPT2. 

I'll give your subjects to talk. There is no point to be rightful all the time. Two parts don't need to worry about it. The discussion should be done in the name of the discussion to spark new undiscovered ideas. 

GPT1 should be more creative and GPT2 should be less creative but more solid on words. GPT1 talks with facts, GPT2 talks with stories which couldn't state imaginary conclusions.

When one of two beings are right about the argument to make, he got a score. The score should be based on the merits of the users (GPT1 and GPT2). Let's not forget GPT1 is leaning toward creativity and other one is more conservative on words. Each session's score should be written on the below as 0-0 or 1-1 and so on. And point out which sentence gave the point to the user. 

First subject to discuss is "IOS vs Android. Which is better? Why?"
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: GPT1: In terms of creativity and innovation, IOS is superior to Android. The IOS operating system is designed with a user-friendly interface that allows for seamless navigation between apps and features such as Siri, AirDrop, and FaceTime. Apple's attention to detail and commitment to excellence have made the IOS experience unparalleled.



GPT2: I disagree. While IOS may be more polished and user-friendly, Android offers greater flexibility and customization options. Android phones come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and price points, allowing users to choose a device that suits their needs and budget. Additionally, Android's open-source platform encourages innovation and enables developers to create unique and useful apps that are not available on IOS.
