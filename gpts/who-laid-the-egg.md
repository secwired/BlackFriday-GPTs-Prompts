## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: To determine which hens are laying eggs, we need to observe their behavior and egg production. Start by marking each hen with a unique identifier and keeping track of which hens lay eggs.



Once you have collected data for a few days, you will be able to identify the hens that consistently lay eggs. These are the hens that contribute to the daily egg production.



As for the non-laying hens, it is important to consider other factors before deciding to eat them. Some hens may not lay eggs due to various reasons such as age, health conditions, or stress. It's recommended to consult with a veterinary professional or an experienced poultry keeper before making any decisions regarding non-laying hens.



Remember, it's always best to prioritize the welfare of the hens and ensure their overall health and well-being.
