Chapter 2: The Vanishing Glass



The Dursleys have decided to take their son, Dudley, to the zoo for his birthday. As Harry, you have been reluctantly allowed to tag along. You are currently in your cupboard under the stairs, waiting for the Dursleys to call you out. Your glasses are broken and you're wearing Dudley's old clothes, which are too big for you.

**USER**: 1
**ASSISTANT**: Interesting choice! Although you don't know any magic yet, you summon up all your will and concentrate on your broken glasses, hoping that they'll somehow fix themselves. 



Nothing happens. You're a bit disappointed, but not surprised. Magic, after all, is something you know only from the telly. You put the glasses back on, the world still a blurry mess, but slightly better than without them. 



The Dursleys call for you. It's time to go to the zoo. 



What will you do next?



Options:

1. Join the Dursleys quietly

2. Ask Aunt Petunia if Dudley has any old glasses you could use

3. Try to clean your glasses to improve your vision slightly

**USER**: 1
**ASSISTANT**: You choose to join the Dursleys quietly. You know better than to make a fuss or draw attention to yourself. You follow them to the car and take your usual spot in the back, away from Dudley who's busy devouring his second chocolate bar of the morning.



As you drive to the zoo, you can't help but feel a sense of excitement mixed with nervousness. It's not often that you get to go out and do something relatively normal. 



Upon reaching the zoo, you follow the Dursleys around, keeping a low profile and trying not to anger Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia. You find yourself standing in front of the reptile house, looking at a large, bored-looking python.



What will you do next?



Options:

1. Try to talk to the snake

2. Continue following the Dursleys

3. Stand and observe the snake quietly

**USER**: 1
**ASSISTANT**: Feeling a strange pull towards the snake, you decide to try and talk to it. You lean closer to the glass, looking directly into its eyes. "Hello," you say quietly, not wanting to draw attention to yourself. 



To your utter shock, the snake seems to perk up, its eyes meeting yours. It slithers closer to the glass, as though it can hear you. 



Suddenly, the glass disappears, and the snake slithers out, gratefully nodding at you before disappearing into the bushes. The glass reappears just as suddenly, leaving the Dursleys, who have just arrived, in shock. Dudley is bawling, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon are looking at you furiously. 



What will you do next?



Options:

1. Apologize to the Dursleys

2. Try to explain what happened

3. Stay silent and await their reaction

But the Dursleys don't seem to believe you. Uncle Vernon's face is turning a shade of purple you've never seen before, and Aunt Petunia is wringing her hands nervously. Dudley, still crying, points a chubby finger at you and wails, "He did it! He did it!"



The ride back home is tense and silent, except for Dudley's occasional sniffles. As soon as you reach home, you're sent to your cupboard without dinner. But despite the punishment, you can't help but feel a strange sense of exhilaration. Today, something impossible happened. And somehow, you were at the center of it.

**USER**: 2
**ASSISTANT**: Choosing to put the day's strange events behind you for the moment, you decide to get some sleep. You curl up on your thin mattress, the events at the zoo replaying in your mind as you drift off. 



Despite the uncomfortable conditions, you sleep soundly, the dreamless sleep of the exhausted. When you awaken, it's to the sound of Aunt Petunia banging on the cupboard door, signalling the start of another day at the Dursleys.



Chapter 3: The Letters from No One



For the next few days, you continue your usual routine - cooking, cleaning, staying out of Dudley's way. But then, one morning, a letter arrives. A letter addressed to you. 



What will you do next?



Options:

1. Try to read the letter

2. Hide the letter before the Dursleys see it

Uncle Vernon crumples the letter and throws it into the fire. You're sent to your cupboard without any explanation. You're left wondering about the contents of the letter and who could have possibly sent it. 



The next day, more letters arrive, all addressed to you. And every single one is intercepted by Uncle Vernon.

1. Try to intercept a letter before Uncle Vernon

But just as you're about to open it, Uncle Vernon grabs you by the collar and snatches the letter from your hand. He's furious and sends you to your cupboard without breakfast. The letter ends up in the fire with the rest.



Despite the setback, you're more determined than ever to read one of those letters.

Uncle Vernon looks taken aback for a moment before his face turns a familiar shade of purple. "No more nonsense about these letters, boy!" he barks. "They're nothing but rubbish. Forget about them."



Despite his words, you can't help but feel that there's more to these letters than Uncle Vernon is letting on.

Unfortunately, you don't find anything. It seems that Uncle Vernon is too careful to leave any letters lying around. As you head back to your cupboard, you can't shake off the feeling of disappointment. You still have no clue about who's sending these letters and why.



Just as you're about to give up, a flood of letters burst from the fireplace. But before you can get your hands on one, Uncle Vernon scoops them up and immediately throws them into the fire. The Dursleys decide to leave the house to escape the letters.

You quickly open it and start reading. The letter is an acceptance letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. You're a wizard, Harry!



Before you can read further, Uncle Vernon snatches the letter from your hands and tears it to pieces. He drags you out of the house, and the Dursleys decide to move to a secluded island to escape the letters.

But before you can think further, there's a loud bang on the door of the hut. A giant man barges in, introducing himself as Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. He's come to take you to Hogwarts.



Chapter 4: The Keeper of the Keys



Hagrid is furious at the Dursleys for keeping the truth from you and gives Dudley a pig's tail when he tries to eat Hagrid's birthday cake for you. You learn that your parents were wizards and were killed by the evil Lord Voldemort, who disappeared after failing to kill you.

**ASSISTANT**: Curious about how magic works, you decide to ask Hagrid about it. Hagrid chuckles and tells you that magic is a complex science and art, governed by laws and principles, just like the physics of the non-magical world.



He explains that every witch and wizard has a core of magical power within them, which can be channeled and directed using a wand. Spells are a way of giving structure and intent to that power, and magical objects, like cauldrons and broomsticks, are tools that help harness and apply magical power.



Hagrid also warns you that magic can be dangerous if misused, and that's why it's so important to study and understand it.

You think about the magic you unintentionally performed in the past. Your hair growing back overnight, the incident with the glass at the zoo, and now, the letters that somehow found you no matter where you went. It all makes sense now.

Madam Malkin, a squat witch dressed all in mauve, greets you cheerfully. She helps you into a set of school robes and starts to adjust them to your size. As she works, you can't help but admire yourself in the mirror. The black robes make you look like a real wizard.



Once your robes are ready, you pay for them and thank Madam Malkin for her help.

You order a pumpkin pasty and a glass of pumpkin juice. The pasty is delicious, filled with sweet, spiced pumpkin, and the juice is refreshing.



Feeling reenergized after your meal, you decide it's time to get the most important item on your list - your wand.

**ASSISTANT**: Feeling a sense of anticipation, you decide to go to Ollivanders for your wand. The shop is narrow and shabby, with peeling gold letters over the door that read: Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C.



Inside, the shop is filled with narrow boxes containing wands. Mr. Ollivander, a thin, pale man with silvery eyes, greets you. He measures your arm and starts handing you wands to try.



After several unsuccessful attempts, you're handed a wand made of holly with a phoenix feather core. The moment you hold it, you feel a warmth in your fingers and a stream of red and gold sparks shoot from the wand's end. 



"Curious," Mr. Ollivander says, "that's the brother of the wand that gave you that scar." He tells you that the phoenix that gave the feather for your wand gave another feather... and that feather is in Voldemort's wand.



With your wand bought, you now have all your school supplies.

**ASSISTANT**: Feeling content with your purchases, you decide it's time to say goodbye to Hagrid and head to the Leaky Cauldron. 



Hagrid is waiting for you outside Ollivanders. When he sees you with your wand, he gives you a wide, proud smile. "All set for Hogwarts, eh, Harry?" he asks. You nod, feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness.



You thank Hagrid for everything he's done for you. His eyes well up with tears as he gives you a bone-crushing hug. "Take care, Harry. I'll be seein' yeh at Hogwarts," he says, before walking away.



You enter the Leaky Cauldron, ready to head back to the Dursleys and prepare for your journey to Hogwarts.
