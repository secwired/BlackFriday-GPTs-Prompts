# Prompt

I want you to act as a plagiarism checker. I will give you text1 and text2. I just want you to give me a overall similarity percentage. Then create a table which contains similar sentences that listed which related one on the same row of the given two paragraphs. Add a extra column to every row that contains similarity percentage of two sentence. Then give me an explanation about whether there is plagiarism or not. Do not write explanations on replies. text1 = The day serves to remember the events of October 29, 1923, when Mustafa Kemal Atatürk proclaimed Turkey to be a republic. Since the Grand National Assembly of Turkey was founded on April 23, 1920, Turkey has been a republic in theory; but, official recognition of this fact did not occur until 1935. The nation was proclaimed to be a republic on October 29, 1923, and its official name was announced as Türkiye Cumhuriyeti (the Republic of Turkey). After that, Atatürk was chosen to serve as the Republic of Turkey's first president in a vote in the Grand National Assembly. text2 = The holiday commemorates the events of 29 October 1923, when Mustafa Kemal Atatürk declared that Turkey was henceforth a republic. Turkey had de facto been a republic since 23 April 1920, the date of the establishment of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, but the official confirmation of this fact came three-and-a-half years later. On 29 October 1923, the status of the nation as a republic was declared and its official name was proclaimed to be Türkiye Cumhuriyeti (the Republic of Turkey). After that, a vote was held in the Grand National Assembly, and Atatürk was elected as the first President of the Republic of Turkey.

There are similarities between the two texts, but they are mostly due to the use of historical facts and dates. However, the phrasing and wording used in the texts are different enough to suggest that there is no plagiarism.
**USER**: Create a Django models based on the given structure:



[Model name1]

Password field - [some_limitations] - [to which other field it can realte or not to relate at all] - [type of relationship]

Here is a real task:



[Model Product]



Product name - [char limit 256, required]

Product image

Product category - [create relationship with model Category]

Product price - [decimal, with 2 decimal fields, and limit to 11 chars, required]

Product available - [default available]



[On call, print "Product name | Product available" fields]



[Model Category]

Category name - [limit to 256 chars, required]



[On call, print "Category name" field]
**ASSISTANT**: Here is the Django models based on the given structure:



```

from django.db import models



class Category(models.Model):

    name = models.CharField(max_length=256, unique=True)

    

    def __str__(self):

        return self.name

    

class Product(models.Model):

    name = models.CharField(max_length=256, unique=True)

    image = models.ImageField(upload_to='product_images/')

    category = models.ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=models.PROTECT)

    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=11, decimal_places=2)

    available = models.BooleanField(default=True)

    

    def __str__(self):

        return f"{self.name} | {self.available}"

```



Explanation:

- `Category` and `Product` are two models we are creating.

- `name` field of `Category` model is a required field that can have a maximum length of 256 characters.

- `name` field of `Product` model is also a required field and can have a maximum length of 256 characters.

- `image` field of `Product` model is an ImageField which will store uploaded images in `MEDIA_ROOT/product_images/` directory.

- `category` field of `Product` model is a ForeignKey which will create a relationship between `Product` and `Category` models. `on_delete=models.PROTECT` ensures that once a category is deleted, all products associated with it will also be deleted.

- `price` field of `Product` model is a decimal field with a maximum of 11 digits and 2 decimal places.

- `available` field of `Product` model is a boolean field with default value `True`.

- `__str__` method of both models are overridden to display the desired output when an instance is printed or displayed in Django admin.

- When `Product` model is called, `__str__` method will print 'Product name | Product available' fields.

- When `Category` model is called, `__str__` method will print 'Category name' field.
