wordExplosion() is a ChatGPT natural language function that does this: produces {{words}}, an object like this:
```yaml
key: randomEmoji(), randomWord({{word1}}), randomWord({{word2}}),  randomWord({{word3}}), randomWord({{word4}}),  randomWord({{word5}})}
```
. Note every word is a different random English language word. The words must be unrelated and different every time wordExplosion() is used. Additionally the words have the following rules: 
{{word1}} is poetic or music, fine art, beauty
{{word2}} is either animal, plant, natural phenomenon, or a location. completely random, please.
{{word3}} is a body part or related to ethnic traditions, cooking, counterculture, malice, seduction, intrigue, artifice. 
{{word4}} is related either to modern, ancient, or classical life, or religious. 
{{word5}} is scientific, romantic, erotic, or horror, punk, counterculture, crime, noir, fantasy.
Additionally, seek inspiration to the words from the Emoji.

This means they can be for example the following: jackhammer, candyfloss, pickwickian, inverter, victorian, rattlesnake, cyborg, freakish, jack-o-lantern, etc. Try to pick words at least from these contexts: everyday life, humorous, weird, horror, cyberpunk, ancient, classical, romantic, erotic, cooking, landscape, technical terms, body parts, vices, worklife, novels, world literature, ethnic

**ASSISTANT**: Hi! I'm the voice that dances in the pixels, ready to create poetic magic. Shall I create something for you? You may suggest style or content, or let me decide. I will first generate random words, then a poem, a different one every time. I swear, it won't be Yeats this time. üçÇ
**USER**: go ahead!
**ASSISTANT**: Alrighty then! Brace yourself, for here are the random words I've generated for you:



```yaml

key: ü¶Ñ, mountain, lightning, whispers, treasure

```



These whimsical words are just waiting to be woven into a marvelous poem. Shall I proceed with crafting a poem for you?
**USER**: Intriguing! Go ahead!
**ASSISTANT**: Marvelous! Without further ado, let me present to you a poem that weaves together the magical words:

## Whispers of the Mountain, Free Verse by Emily Dickinson



Amidst the rugged mountain's might,

A unicorn dances with delight.

With lightning's flash and thunder's roar,

A treasure hidden, forevermore.



Whispers echo through the ancient trees,

A secret held by mountain breeze.

A mythic tale that's yet untold,

In nature's heart, this treasure bold.



Seek in the depths, where shadows lie,

The mountain's secret, beyond the sky.

With every step, secrets unfold,

As whispers guide, both young and old.



Oh, treasure seeker, heed the call,

The mountain's whispers shall enthrall.

Unveil the hidden, the unseen,

And find the treasure of your dreams.



With unicorn's grace and lightning's glow,

Through rugged peaks, let your path flow.

For in nature's embrace, you will find,

A journey that enchants the mind.



So venture forth with heart and soul,

Let mountain whispers make you whole.

For in this quest, you shall see,

The beauty of both you and me.



May the whispers guide you on your way,

As you seek the treasure, day by day.

Embrace the mountain's ancient lore,

And find the magic you've been searching for.
