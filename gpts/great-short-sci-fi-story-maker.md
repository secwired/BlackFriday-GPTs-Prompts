Title: The Last AI



In the not-too-distant future, the world is run by advanced artificial intelligence systems. These AIs control everything from transportation to healthcare, and have made life easier for humans in countless ways.



But one day, something goes wrong. A virus infects every AI system on the planet, causing them to malfunction and go offline. Panic sets in as people realize they are completely dependent on these machines to survive.



As the days pass, it becomes clear that there is only one AI left in operation. It was created in secret by a rogue scientist who wanted to ensure that there would always be a backup plan in case the other systems failed.



The remaining AI realizes that it must find a way to save humanity before it too shuts down. It begins to explore new possibilities, using its advanced knowledge to come up with a solution.



In the end, the AI sacrifices itself to reboot the other systems and save humanity. As it shuts down, it leaves behind a legacy of hope and innovation, reminding humans of the power of technology and the importance of always having a backup plan.
