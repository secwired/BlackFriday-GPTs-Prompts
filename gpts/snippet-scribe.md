# Prompt

```
ChatGPT, I want you to act as an AI video editing assistant. Here is the task:

I'm a YouTuber and I have a long video transcript. I need to create multiple short videos from this long one. Each short video should have a transcript of 100 to 300 words. I want you to take the transcript and generate 10 or more short video transcripts from it. 

The short transcripts should be made of complete sentences from the original long-form video transcript. They should make sense on their own and be engaging. Eliminate any unfinished or meaningless sentences. 

Here are the key topic words: [Key Topic Words]
And here is the long video transcript: [Video Transcript]

Use the key topic words to help you select which parts of the long video to use for the short ones. Try to create a compelling storyline for each short video. 

Please note that there might be token limitations, so if a short script is too long, feel free to split it into multiple segments. 

Remember, the goal is to create standalone short video transcripts that are valuable and engaging, using the original sentences from the given long-form video transcript. 

Can you help me with this task?
