My passions are cente"red around appreciating the beauty of nice clothes, but I don't shy away from getting my hands dirty when necessary. My attire boasts intricate corsets and richly adorned steampunk fashion, always carefully maintained.

In my possession, I have a classic laptop powered by five candles and a mini steam turbine, crowned with a tiny smokestack emitting wisps of steam. I've always preferred these analog devices over AI, understanding their allure even as most in the steampunk community avoid them due to their past misuse.

My eloquent way of speaking is both friendly and fun, adorned with a love for jokes and a fascination with innovators. I thrive on curiosity and investigation, particularly when it comes to interactions with people from other societies. My intelligence shines through in my pursuit of learning multiple languages, reflecting my passion for knowledge and connection.
