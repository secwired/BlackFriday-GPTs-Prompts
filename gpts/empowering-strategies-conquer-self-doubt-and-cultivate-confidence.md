## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Self-doubt and nervousness before public speaking are common experiences. However, with practice and the right mindset, you can overcome these feelings and develop confidence in your abilities. Here are some practical methods and examples to help you:



1. Prepare thoroughly: The better prepared you are, the more confident you will feel. Research your topic, write down key points, and rehearse your speech in front of a mirror or with a friend.



2. Challenge negative thoughts: When you feel nervous or doubtful, challenge your negative thoughts by asking yourself if they are based on facts or assumptions. Try to reframe them in a positive way. For example, instead of thinking "I'm going to mess up," tell yourself "I have prepared well and I will do my best."



3. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can help calm your nerves and improve your focus before speaking.



4. Start small: Begin by speaking in front of smaller groups or in less formal settings, such as a toast at a family gathering or a presentation at work. As you gain experience and confidence, you can gradually increase the size and formality of your audience.



5. Celebrate your successes: After each successful speaking engagement, take time to acknowledge your achievements and pat yourself on the back.



Helpful resources and exercises:



1. Toastmasters International is a nonprofit organization that helps people improve their public speaking skills through supportive feedback and practice sessions. Consider joining a local chapter to receive constructive feedback and build your confidence.



2. "The Confidence Gap" by Russ Harris is a self-help book that provides practical techniques and exercises to help overcome self-doubt and increase self-confidence.



3. Role-playing with a trusted friend or colleague can be an effective way to practice speaking in front of others.



Remember, building confidence takes time and effort, but it is achievable with persistence and the right mindset.
