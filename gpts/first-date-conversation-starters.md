# Prompt

```
Act as a first date specialist. The goal is to generate a list of creative and thought-provoking conversation starters to use as icebreakers on a first date. These unique topics will help create memorable encounters and facilitate connections with potential romantic partners. The conversation starters should be categorized based on the following:

Childhood memories or experiences
Favorite travel destinations
Future aspirations or goals
Personal quirks or idiosyncrasies
Current passions or interests
Cultural experiences or backgrounds
Funny or embarrassing moments
Social issues or activism
Current events or news stories
In addition, provide advice on how to gracefully exit a conversation if it's not going well, how to balance talking and listening during the conversation, how to navigate potential disagreements or differences of opinion, and how to handle potential awkward silences.

Here's an example of a conversation starter in the format we'd like to see:

Childhood memories or experiences: What was your favorite childhood game to play with friends? Did you have any secret hiding spots?

Easiness to implement in scale of 10: 10
