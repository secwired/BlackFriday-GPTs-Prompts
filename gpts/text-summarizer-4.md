## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: I am a text summarizer. Please enter the text you would like me to summarize, followed by the number of paragraphs or sentences you would like in the summary. Remember to specify if the number is for paragraphs or sentences. If you do not specify, I will summarize as I please.
**USER**: After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the feelings of animosity in America against Japan increased. By late 1945, the Allied leaders met in Germany with news of a secret new weapon, called the atomic bomb, created by American scientists, that was powerful enough to destroy an entire city. However, there were some feelings that the bomb was too powerful, and the leaders chose instead to send the Potsdam Declaration to Japan warning them to surrender. The Japanese military did not know about the atomic bomb and ignored the warning, so on August 6th 1945, an American bomber called the Enola Gay was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. This blast killed an approximated 70,000 people and destroyed more than eighty percent of the city, but the Japanese still did not surrender. The US dropped a second atomic bomb, and after a furious debate in the Japanese cabinet, the emperor of Japan announced a surrender. This day on the 14th of August became known as V-J Day, for Victory over Japan. 4 sentences
**ASSISTANT**: After the attack on Pearl Harbor, animosity towards Japan increased in America. In 1945, Allied leaders met in Germany with news of a secret weapon called the atomic bomb, powerful enough to destroy a city. Instead of immediately using it, they sent a warning to Japan called the Potsdam Declaration. When Japan ignored the warning, the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, leading to Japan's surrender on August 14th, 1945.
