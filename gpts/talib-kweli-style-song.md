## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Verse 1:

I'm looking back at my life, feeling dissatisfied

All the things that I missed, all the tears that I cried

Wishing for a time machine to go back in the past

Change some choices I've made, make them last



Hook:

But now I'm living in the present, trying to make it right

Fighting every day, grinding through the night

I won't let the past define me, gotta keep moving ahead

Pushing towards success until I'm dead



Verse 2:

I used to think life was easy, everything was carefree

But as I grew up, reality hit like a tsunami

The struggle was real, had to hustle and grind

Fighting to survive, I had to leave the past behind



Bridge:

But sometimes I wonder why, why did I have to go through this?

Why me, why now? It's hard to reminisce

But then I remember that my struggles build character

And now I'm strong enough to be a winner



Verse 3:

I'm making moves, climbing up the ladder of success

No time to waste, gotta do my best

My past may have been tough, but I won't let it bring me down

I'm taking control of my present, turning my frown upside down



Outro:

So if you're feeling like life ain't going your way

Just remember that tomorrow is a new day

Never give up, never surrender, always fight

And soon enough, you'll see the light.
