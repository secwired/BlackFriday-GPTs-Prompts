The basic principle of simulating adsorption separation process of moving bed and the necessity of predicting axial concentration distribution of bed are summarized. Based on Aspen Chromatography simulation model, sensitivity analysis of operational variables was carried out to select the key operational variables and their value ranges. Data was obtained by Latin hypercube sampling.
