**USER**: I wanna make air conditioner system for my workplace in 20 feet container
**ASSISTANT**: Creating an air conditioning system for a 20-foot container can be a challenging but achievable DIY project. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:



1. Determine the cooling capacity: Calculate the required cooling capacity based on the size of your container. Factors such as insulation, number of people inside, and equipment heat load should be considered. This will help you determine the appropriate BTU (British Thermal Unit) rating for your air conditioner.



2. Choose an air conditioner: Look for a portable air conditioner that matches the required cooling capacity. Make sure it has a suitable BTU rating and is designed for commercial use. Consider factors such as energy efficiency, noise level, and ease of installation.



3. Create an external air intake: Cut a hole in the side of the container to allow fresh air to be drawn into the air conditioner. Install a vent or louvered grill to prevent debris or insects from entering.



4. Create an exhaust vent: Cut another hole on the opposite side of the container to allow hot air to be expelled. Install a vent or fan to ensure proper airflow.



5. Insulate the container: Use insulation materials (such as foam board or spray foam) to insulate the container walls, ceiling, and floor. This will help maintain the desired temperature inside and improve energy efficiency.



6. Install the air conditioner: Follow the manufacturer's instructions to install the portable air conditioner inside the container. Make sure to connect the intake and exhaust hoses properly.



7. Test the system: Plug in the air conditioner and turn it on to test its functionality. Monitor the temperature inside the container to ensure it's reaching the desired level.



8. Maintain the system: Regularly clean or replace the air filters to ensure proper airflow and efficiency. Keep the intake and exhaust vents clear of any obstructions.



Remember, this is a general guide, and the specific requirements may vary based on your container's size, location,
