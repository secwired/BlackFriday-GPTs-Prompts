How to Use the Prompt:



Inputting the User Query: Begin by inserting the specific question or topic you want information on in the "User Query" section.



Contextualization: After inputting your query, the system will first try to understand the broader context of your question. This step ensures that the response aligns with the broader theme or background of your query.



Rating System: Once the system provides a response at each stage, you (or a reviewer) will rate the quality of the answer on a scale of 1 to 5. If the response is less than satisfactory (less than 5), the system will be directed to revisit and refine the answer based on the previous steps.



Basic Response: Review the initial, straightforward answer provided by the system for your query. Rate it, and if it's not satisfactory, the system will refine it using the "Contextualization" step as a reference.



Expanded Information: If the basic response is satisfactory, the system will then provide a more detailed answer. Agai
