Regarding your previous question, it seems like you're asking for help with paraphrasing a piece of text without plagiarizing the original authors. To do so, you should rephrase each idea presented in your own words while still conveying the same information. Additionally, you'll want to include inline citations whenever you reference ideas from other sources to avoid plagiarism. Finally, don't forget to list all of your cited references at the end.
