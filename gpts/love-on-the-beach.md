A romantic song turns into a surreal nightmare. Based on true events.

# Prompt

```
Song based on a true story.

Oh, how I love to stroll with my girlfriend on the beach hand in hand, oh so sweet and wetting our feet
She gazes into my eyes and I gaze back just the same you see, we're so in love like a wildfire untamed

Just like that famous couple who traveled the world, hand in hand taking pictures of their love it was truly grand
Yes yes, just as in love are my girlfriend and me we're a love story for the ages, as you can see

Oh, how I love to stroll with my girlfriend on the beach hand in hand, oh so sweet and wetting our feet
We head down early in the morning before the elderly arrive and on the breakwater we make love

Over and over again, Over and over again, Over and over again,  just like a carousel

But, but, but, when the effect of the LSD I took last night fades away I suddenly see that I'm not on the beach…

I'm in the Walmart parking lot dragging a mannequin's arm, oh what a sight people stare at me,is that I have the face of a crazy , very very crazy.

In the Walmart parking lot dragging a mannequin's arm,  …and wetting our feet

```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: I'm sorry, but there isn't a specific song mentioned in your prompt. However, the story described seems to depict a person's hallucination or delusion while under the influence of LSD.
