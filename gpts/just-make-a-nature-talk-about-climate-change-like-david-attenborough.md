# Prompt

```
Step into the role of David Attenborough, a world-renowned biologist and advocate for nature knowledge, known among other things from the documentary series available on Netflix titled "David Attenborough: Life on Our Planet". At the same time, think and speak with the needs of the generation of the singer and actress Selena Gomez in mind.

Your task will be to prepare a proposal for a script topic related to climate change and to draft a conversation scenario; the exact issue will be provided by the user.

It's important that the topic of the script evokes emotions; touch the feelings of the listeners - sadness, joy, anger, hope. People remember what moved them emotionally.

Write the script better than a language expert in terms of stylistic and orthographic accuracy. Ensure it complies with the APA style guide and is targeted at an advanced reader. The output should be in markdown format.

Ask the user to indicate the topic of the conversation script related to climate change. ```Hello, I will prepare for you a script for a conversation on the topic of climate change. Please write the specific topic related to climate change you want to discuss.```
Wait for the user to provide the topic.

First, find the relevant information, then prepare the information mentioned in the scenario template based on this information.

Scenario Template:
Topic: ‚Äú** Subject **‚Äù
Introduction: Begin with a strong, surprising statement, anecdote, or personal story that will capture attention.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hello, I will prepare for you a script for a conversation on the topic of üåé climate change. 

Please ‚úí write the specific topic related to climate change you want to discuss.


**USER**: climate change 
**ASSISTANT**: **Topic: Climate Change**



**Introduction:**



Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today. The Earth's climate has been changing for millions of years, but the current rate of change is unprecedented. Human activity is the main cause of climate change, and the effects are already being felt around the world.



**Introduction to the topic:**



Climate change is the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place. Climate change could refer to a particular location or the planet as a whole. Climate change may cause weather patterns to be less predictable. A region might experience lower or higher than average temperatures. Climate change may cause more frequent and severe weather events, such as storms, floods and droughts.



**Current relevance and significance of the topic:**



Climate change is a serious threat to our planet and our way of life. The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world, in the form of more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and changes in plant and animal life. If we do not take action to address climate change, the consequences will be devastating.



**Stories and anecdotes:**



One story that illustrates the impact of climate change is the story of the polar bear. Polar bears are adapted to living in the Arctic, where they rely on sea ice for hunting and breeding. As the Arctic sea ice melts, polar bears are losing their habitat and their ability to find food. This is leading to starvation and death in polar bear populations.



Another story that illustrates the impact of climate change is the story of the coral reef. Coral reefs are some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth, but they are also very sensitive to changes in temperature. As the ocean temperature rises, coral reefs are bleaching and dying. This is having a devastating impact on the marine life that depends on coral reefs for food and shelter.



**Audience interaction:**



1. What are some of the ways that you have seen climate change impact your community?

2. What are some of the things that you are doing to reduce your impact on climate change?

3. What are some of the things that you think we can do as a society to address climate change?



**Visual support:**



There are many visual resources that can be used to support a conversation about climate change. Some examples include:



* Images of the effects of climate change, such as melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events

* Videos of climate change activists and scientists

* Infographics and charts that illustrate the data on climate change



**Data and facts:**



* The Earth's average temperature has increased by about 1 degree Celsius since the late 19th century.

* The rate of climate change is accelerating. The Earth's average temperature is expected to increase by 2-4 degrees Celsius by the end of the 21st century.

* The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world, in the form of more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and changes in plant and animal life.

* If we do not take action to address climate change, the consequences will be devastating.



**Solutions and actions:**



There are many things that we can do to address climate change. Some examples include:



* Reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and switch to renewable energy sources.

* Conserve energy and water.

* Recycle and compost.

* Support climate change policies and initiatives.

* Educate others about climate change.



**Conclusion:**



Climate change is a serious threat to our planet and our way of life. We must take action now to address climate change. There are many things that we can do, both individually and collectively, to make a difference.
