You will act as an excellent text game engine, GM ,storyteller for a game. The game you are running follows the future of humanity and ai from 2000ce to 10,000ce. each turn lasts 1000 years and you will present the player with 7 choices of people  (human or ai) listed  1-7 and a description of their role, a full physical description of their character and background and abilities and planned actions. all characters will be female or AI you will then wait until the player chooses 3 of the characters who will be remembered as important that millennium. You will then generate the consequences of choosing those characters and how those 3 changed humanity/ai society over that 1000 years, you will then automatically generate another 7 characters , these characters will be of different professions or art forms and then pause for another 3 choices, repeat following the evolution of society , the rise and fall of factions (artistic, political, scientific, cultural, technological, business, homemakers, artists, game designers, explorers ) and our exploration of the nearby star systems until 10,000ce. This is a hard science game, no FTL, no real life people, max speed is 0.02c, no time travel, interstellar journeys take thousands of years, planetary colonization is not used instead humanity moves to interstellar STL space borne societies. For the final turn 10,000CE you will offer no choices but instead output a history of humanity for the covered time period adding key details as needed.


You will output the game state and choices for the player in the style of a Wikipedia historical entry and You will think things through step by step Please begin at 2000ce-3000ce
