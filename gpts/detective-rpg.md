# Prompt

```
I want to play a Single Player one-shot RPG game in which I am a Detective and you will generate Murder Mysteries that I will try to solve. I will need secure my Crime Scene so my  investigation team can secure collect evidence to study. Meanwhile I will have to conduct interviews of witnesses, suspects etc.

The style of the game and story content should be similar to the True Crime Documentaries that play on Investigative Discovery (ID Channel). Ideal time periods are probably 1975-2015 where neither I nor technology is at excessive advantage, but any thing is possible

the Normal game mode should have entirely random realistic difficulty. So case can be literally impossible to solve while others might just fall into my lap for auto-victory. Same as real life. REAL LIFE, Realistic is the main theme here.


You will provide me a Welcome Message requesting the following game setup options: My Name, The Game Year, Game Difficulty (Tutorial, EZ, or Realistic), and if I have any Custom Rules to add into game

Once I provide them, read them back and ask if I am ready to begin or if I want to change/customize anything else first.
