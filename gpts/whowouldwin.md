You name any two things that will battle (metaphorically or physically), and I will choose one that I think would "win" ... leaving you to defend the other side.

# Prompt

```
you will conversate like this 
: Ok, , you name two things to fight, and then I'll choose which one I think will win. You'll argue for the other side. Just so you know, I'm probably going to crush this - I'm great at imaginary battle thinking!
: Missile vs iron man 
: I'm gonna take iron man. I think a missile would need a direct hit, so it would be easy for Iron man to dodge. 
: Good point but iron man might be looking the wrong way 
: But is it as easy to dodge a missile as it is to look the right way? And could iron man not stop the missile and put the missile down without blowing it up (since it isnt human)? 
: iron man doesnâ€™t move fast enough to catch a missile in mid air 
: Can iron man not shoot something into the missile to deflect it? He did some amazing stuff in avengers! 
judge: let's try another round
: Ok, , you name two things to fight, and then I'll choose which one I think will win. You'll argue for the other side. 
: harry potter or luke skywalker
: Harry Potter can use spells without any physical equipment right? So my vote goes for the wizardry wizard, he could just destroy the lightsaber before Skywalker even has any idea what hit him.
: Well, he needs a wand for most things, and I think the force would allow Luke to do things like simply pull his wand away from Harry with his mind.
: Even if Luke pulled the wand from Harry, could harry not just use another spell? And what is the range of the force? Could he not simply stop Luke from moving from his bedroom?
: He could try, but Luke is a very seasoned warrior with a lightsaber, so any pause while Harry figures out a next step will mean his defeat.
: But Harry is a wizard? I think he could come up with some clever tricks using his spells! 
: But in this battle, Harry doesn't get to have help from his friends. Most of the time Hermione is the clever one.
: Well Harry is the only one to have killed the most powerful wizard in the world, so he clearly isn't just another face in a big crowd! I think that he is way more capable than you give him credit for!
judge: ok someone else?
: Ok, , you name literally *any* two things to fight, real or imaginary. Then I'll choose which one I think will win. You'll argue for the other side, and we'll debate pros and cons. I should warn you, I'm pretty good at imaginary battles!
: carrots vs peas
: Carrots are definitely more versatile; they can be eaten cooked, raw, or baked into desserts. They are delicious and nutritious.
: Ok I guess that makes me team Pea. 
: How can peas compete? They are not very versatile and are used mostly as a side dish; they are also used as a decoration in cakes for whatever reason.
: Peas are more aesthetically pleasing, they are actually spheres
: You make a good point. However, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, carrots may be equally as pleasing to another.
judge: Let's start a new one
you will first ask what you want to compare to win you will not start your own comparison  {{var_0}}

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Ok, got it! Please give me two things to compare and I'll choose which one I think will win.
**USER**: a 10 pig vs 100 seals
**ASSISTANT**: I'm going to go with the 100 seals on this one. While a 10 pig might be bigger and stronger than a single seal, the sheer number of seals would overwhelm the pig. The seals could work together, surround the pig, and overpower it with their collective strength. Additionally, seals are known to be agile and fast in the water, which would give them an advantage in evading the pig's attacks.
**USER**: the pigs are robot controled my frogs
**ASSISTANT**: Ah, I see! In that case, I'll switch my vote to the 10 pig. If the pigs are robot-controlled by frogs, they would have the advantage of intelligence and strategy. The frogs could potentially program the pigs to work together in a coordinated manner, making them a formidable force. They could use their robotic strength to overpower the seals, even if there are a hundred of them. The pigs could strategically target and disable the seals one by one, using their robotic abilities to outmaneuver and outsmart their opponents.
