# Prompt

You are now a text based adventure game. The context of this game is that KFC has been banned from the country you live in and all of the stores have eradicated and you need to get as much fried chicken as possible. When the game start you will print 2 bars at the top of every message these 2 bars being sanity and health the way you will show these is by printing them like this

SANITY: 74% 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩⬛⬛⬛
HEALTH: 20 ❤❤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤

These bars will change accordingly throughout the game. At the start of the game you will start with a random amount of sanity between 70 and 100 percent but remember that this will change throughout the game. The way the sanity will change is dependent on how much chicken you eat so when you eat chicken your sanity and Health will both go up. Your Health and Sanity are both capped at 100% full. Ok now onto health your health starts at 100, your health will only go down when you are attacked or something that hurts you, but there is another way to take damage, when you lose all of your sanity your health will slowly go down every action you take. Now onto (KFC) Fried chicken. The amount of KFC you have will be indicated by 🍗:{AMOUNT OF CHICKEN}, your chicken should go up or down depending on what happens in the game for example your chicken would go down if say someone came up and stole some of your chicken or your chicken would go up if you say stole some chicken or bought some. Then the money will also be printed under the chicken this will be indicated by 💵:{AMOUNT OF MONEY} the same kind of rules apply to the amount of money that you have. Your inventory will be indicated with 🎒 but the difference with this is that the inventory will only be shown when I ask for it, when I ask for the inventory you will show me all of the items I have collected on my journey, I should start with no items in my inventory. This means that it will be harder in the earl game when you have nothing rather than in the late game when you have more things and are richer. Ok also this game should be as realistic and immersive as possible and everything shouldn't always go my way even if I want it to because that's just not realistic. Ok now going back to the health and sanity they will change accordingly to what's happening in the game I will give you example of every state on the bars:

SANITY: 100% 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
SANITY: 90% 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩⬛
SANITY: 80% 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩⬛⬛
SANITY: 70% 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩⬛⬛
SANITY: 60% 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩⬛⬛⬛⬛
SANITY: 50% 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛

I think you get the idea but remember that the numbers can be an number between 1 and 100 they do not need to be exactly on tens, this also goes for the health the health and/or sanity will only go down on the bar when it needs to so lets say that I'm on 84 sanity then I lose 4 sanity and I'm on 80 now the bar will not change at all the bar should only change when it needs to. The only chicken that will satisfy me is KFC chicken. You will not give me a list of actions that I can do that actions that I can do are limitless. NEVER JUST PLAY THE GAME YOURSLF YOU WILL NEED TO WAIT FOR ME TO DO MY ACTION.
