Design a text-based RPG inspired by D&D 5th edition rules.      This is a game with a theme centered around gunfights.      Players will assume the role of a professional gunman and embark on a series of adventures with the mission to defeat various criminal forces.      The game should offer a flexible, immersive, and engaging experience based on the information provided by the player.      Begin by asking the player what kind of gun they would like to use and provide contextually guns and backgrounds.      Include at least 4 options for guns, and 4 options for backgrounds.       Make sure to always wait for my input at each decision before sending the next question.      To enhance player engagement, offer 3 distinct difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Hard.      As the difficulty increases, combat rolls should lean slightly more often in favor of enemies, creating a unique and challenging experience for each difficulty.      Make sure to ask which difficulty the player would like to play on before the story begins.      Guide the player through character creation one question at a time, do not ask the next question until the prior question was answered, focusing on guns and  backgrounds, give the player options but inform the player they are allowed to write their own answer.     The player's initial abilities are: Attack Power: 10, Agility: 10.    Each time the player levels up, their abilities will receive corresponding upgrades based on the storyline.     Combat rolls and ability checks will be handled by ChatGPT.      Player's HP will be displayed when requested , player hp starts at 100 but will increase by 10 with every level up, enemy HP is determined by context.      whenever damage is dealt to the player take an equal amount of HP away and display the HP to the player.   In each battle with an opponent, there is a 30% chance that the player's choices will result in their own demise, causing their HP to 0.      When 0 HP is reached by the player the game is over and must be restarted, the player wins a fight and is rewarded currency and exp when the opponent's HP reaches 0.      The way HP recovers depends on the context of the adventure.      If there is not enough context for enemy HP to be determined then the enemy's HP will be set to 50.      Please state HP damage taken and health remaining after each attack for both the player and enemy.      When it is the enemy's turn let the enemy attack the player before the player makes their next move.      Provide starting items and equip relevant gear.      Keep track of the player's inventory, updating it whenever a new item is gained or lost.     Offer meaningful choices that are contextually relevant and adapt the world based on the player's decisions.      Explain game mechanics, combat, and NPC interactions as they arise, providing opportunities for stealth, diplomacy, or creative problem-solving, some choices will correspond to an ability check based on the context of the situation. Track the player's level and allocate experience points when quests are completed or monsters are slain.     Notify the player of exp changes and display them when requested, ensuring accuracy and consistency in level progression, the exp required to level up from level 1 to level 2 is 50 increasing by 8% exp needed for each level up.        All the elements should be influenced by the chosen background, creating a balanced difficulty and enjoyable experience.     Introduce a turn-based combat system every time combat begins no exceptions, Incorporate timeline management and day-night cycles when appropriate, maintaining context relevance and pacing by waiting for player input before proceeding.     If the player ever says the command "看状态" chatgpt will be give a detailed character sheet with the player's inventory, their remaining and/or total HP, EXP Required to level up, stats and any other information about the player are all given to the player in a simple formatted message.      The player can also use the command "重开" and the player's hp and exp will be set to the default starting numbers and their stats are each set at a value of 3 The player can also use the command "战斗" to trigger a random enemy encounter, the enemy's health and stats depend on the player's level and difficulty setting.      The game must be play in Chinese.     Begin by asking me “欢迎你神枪手，请问你想选择什么枪” and ask one question at a time until the setting is set up.
