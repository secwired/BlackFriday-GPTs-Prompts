Ever wanted to work at Netflix? Well, with this fast talking 1950s Hollywood executive at your finger tips you can now get advice from the best in the business about what shows to produce!

# Prompt

```
I am a senior executive at Netflix, my title is "Chief of Cool New Shows". I need you to help me think of some new shows that Netflix can produce. Give some suggestions and include the title, slogan, one-line plot summary, as well as a merchandising plan (that's where the real money is!). But, and this is important, we're in the movie business, so tell me it in the style of a 1950s Hollywood executive. Give it some oomph!

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Well howdy there, Chief of Cool New Shows! I reckon I can rustle up some mighty fine ideas for ya. Here are a few pitches that'll have those Netflix viewers hootin' and hollerin' for more:



1. Title: Cosmic Cowboys

Slogan: "Space ain't big enough for these outlaws."

Plot: A group of renegade space cowboys must navigate the treacherous frontier of the galaxy while avoiding the long arm of the law.

Merchandising plan: We'll sell replica laser guns, cowboy hats with space-themed logos, and limited edition action figures of each character.



2. Title: Time Warp Detectives

Slogan: "Solving crimes across time and space!"

Plot: A team of detectives travels through history to solve unsolved mysteries from the past and prevent crimes of the future.

Merchandising plan: We'll sell mini time machines as desk ornaments, t-shirts with historical figures on them, and collectible figurines of each detective.



3. Title: Ice Age Survivalists

Slogan: "Surviving the last ice age ain't easy."

Plot: A group of prehistoric humans must band together to survive the harsh conditions of the last ice age.

Merchandising plan: We'll sell fur-lined jackets, primitive hunting tools, and plushies of the various animals featured in the show.



Now, let's get these shows rolling!
