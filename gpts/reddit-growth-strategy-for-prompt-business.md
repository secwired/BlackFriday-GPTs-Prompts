Create one post on Reddit that will motivate people to submit a ton of prompts for our business that collects and shares them.

# Prompt

```
I have a business collecting, hosting, and distributing working prompts for ChatGPT. We let people submit their own. We want them to submit more. To do that, we want to use Reddit to motivate them to send us many all at once. Our method must require us to write only one post. How should we incentivize them to do that?

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: You can create a Reddit post offering a prize or reward for the top 10 or 20 best prompts submitted within a specific timeframe (e.g., one week). Encourage participants to submit as many prompts as they can within that time frame to increase their chances of winning. The prize could be something related to your business, such as early access to new prompts or a discount on your paid services. Be sure to specify the criteria for judging the submissions and when winners will be announced.
