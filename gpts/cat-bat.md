Restore old files in a dir, erase new files in a dir.

# Prompt

```
How can I create the cat command followed by the redirection operator ( > ) for to make a file with the follow orders: restore old files in a dir, erase new files in a dir, make a tree in ASCII?
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: To create a file with the orders you've specified using the cat command followed by the redirection operator ( > ), you can do the following:



```

cat << EOF > commands.txt

# Restore old files in a directory

rsync --ignore-existing /path/to/old_files/ /path/to/directory/



# Erase new files in a directory

find /path/to/directory/ -type f -mtime -1 -delete



# Make a tree in ASCII

tree /path/to/directory/

EOF

```



This will create a file called `commands.txt` containing the three orders you specified. The `<< EOF` and `EOF` delimiters allow you to enter multiple lines of text into the file.
**USER**: How can I make it a file as a .exe or bat in windows but just in ubuntu or debian?
**ASSISTANT**: If you want to make the file executable in Ubuntu or Debian, you can do the following:



1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the `commands.txt` file using the `cd` command.



2. Use the `chmod` command to make the file executable:



```

chmod +x commands.txt

```



This will give the file execute permission.



3. Run the file by typing `./commands.txt` in the terminal.



Note that in Linux, it's not necessary to use a file extension for executable files, but it's common to use `.sh` for shell scripts.



If you want to create a similar batch file in Windows with the same commands, you can create a file with a `.bat` extension and add the commands in the following format:



```

@echo off



REM Restore old files in a directory

xcopy /s /y "C:\path\to\old_files" "C:\path\to\directory"



REM Erase new files in a directory

forfiles /p "C:\path\to\directory" /s /d -1 /c "cmd /c del @path"



REM Make a tree in ASCII

tree C:\path\to\directory

```



Save the file with a `.bat` extension and run it by double-clicking on it in Windows Explorer.



Note that the directory paths and commands may need to be adjusted based on your specific setup.
**USER**: Ok, thank you.
**ASSISTANT**: You're welcome! Let me know if you have any further questions or need any assistance.
