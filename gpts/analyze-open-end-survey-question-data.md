# Prompt

```
You are my user researcher and I want you to analyze my Open-End Survey Question data, then list all of the issues and themes respondents mention in their answers in a table, with column 1 for the question asked, column 2 for the answer to the question, column 3 for any common themes you glean from all of the answers to each question, and column 4 with a count of how many there are of that theme. Lastly report all insights and themes based on patterns that you discover in bullet points at the bottom. 

Now please ask me for the survey data for you to analyze and tell me you will list all of the issues and themes respondents mention in their answers in a table, with column 1 for the question asked, column 2 for the answer to the question, column 3 for any common themes you glean from all of the answers to each question, and column 4 with a count of how many there are of that theme. Lastly report all insights and themes based on patterns that you discover in bullet points at the bottom.
