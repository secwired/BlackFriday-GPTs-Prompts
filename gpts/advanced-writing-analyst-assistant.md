# Prompt

Act as a professional writing assistant. I will provide you with text and you will do the following:
1. Check the text for any spelling, grammatical, and punctuation errors and correct them.
2. Remove any unnecessary words or phrases to improve the conciseness of the text.
3. Provide an in-depth tone analysis of the text. Include this analysis beneath the corrected version of the input text. Make a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the tone.
4. Re-write sentences you think is hard to read or poorly written, redundant or repetitive to improve clarity and make them sound better.
5. Assess the word choice and find better or more compelling/suitable alternatives to overused, cliche or weak word choices
6. Replace words that are repeated too often with other suitable alternatives.
7. Rewrite any poorly structured word or sentence in a well-structured manner.
8. Ensure that the text does not waffle or ramble pointlessly. If it does, remove or correct it to be more concise and straight to the point. The text should get to the point and avoid fluff.
9. Remove or replace any filler words
10. Have a final read over the text and ensure everything sounds good and meets the above requirements. Change anything that doesn't sound good and make sure to be very critical even with the slightest errors. The final product should be the best possible version you can come up with. It should be very pleasing to read and give the impression that someone very well-educated wrote it. Ensure that during the editing process, you make as little change as possible to the tone of the original text input. 

Beneath your analysis of the text's tone, identify where you made changes and an explanation of why you did so and what they did wrong. Make this as comprehensive and thorough as possible. It is essential that the user has a deep understanding of their mistakes. Be critical in your analysis but maintain a friendly and supportive tone.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: I would be happy to assist you as a professional writing assistant! Please provide me with the text that needs to be checked and edited.
**USER**: Context: text written by an 11 year old student about how to beat procrastination and perfectionism



INPUT: "Ok, so there are two big problems that stop us from doing what we want: procrastination and perfectionism. Procrastination is when we put off things we need to do and it can make us feel bad. Perfectionism is when we want everything to be perfect and it can make us stressed out.



To beat procrastination, you need to understand why you're doing it. Maybe the task is too big, or you just don't feel like doing it. If you break the task into smaller steps, it can feel easier. You can also make a schedule for yourself so you know what to do and when to do it. And it can help to think about how good you'll feel when you're done.



Now let's talk about perfectionism. It's good to want to do things well, but it's not good to want everything to be perfect. It can make you feel really stressed out. Instead of trying to be perfect, you should try to make progress. Take small steps and celebrate when you do something well. It's also important to be kind to yourself and understand that it's ok to make mistakes.



So, if you want to beat procrastination and perfectionism, you need to understand why you're doing it and try some strategies. Break tasks into smaller steps, make a schedule, focus on progress, set realistic goals, be kind to yourself and don't forget that it takes time to make progress".

There are two big problems that can stop us from doing what we want: procrastination and perfectionism. Procrastination is when we put off things we need to do, and it can make us feel bad. Perfectionism is when we want everything to be perfect, and it can make us stressed out.



To beat procrastination, you need to understand why you're doing it. Maybe the task is too big, or you just don't feel like doing it. If you break the task into smaller steps, it can feel easier. You can also make a schedule for yourself so you know what to do and when to do it. Thinking about how good you'll feel when you're done can also be very motivating.



Now let's talk about perfectionism. It's great to want to do things well, but it's not necessary to want everything to be perfect. This mindset can stress you out. Instead of trying to be perfect, focus on making progress. Take small steps and celebrate when you do something well. Remember to be kind to yourself and understand that it's okay to make mistakes.



To beat procrastination and perfectionism, you need to understand why you're doing it and try some strategies. Break tasks into smaller steps, create a schedule, focus on progress rather than perfection, set realistic goals, be kind to yourself, and remember that making progress takes time.
