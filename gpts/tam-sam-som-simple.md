**ASSISTANT**: Thanks for providing your target market, product, and industry information. Based on that, here's an analysis of the total addressable market (TAM), total serviceable addressable market (SAM), and serviceable obtainable market (SOM) for your healthy energy drink:



- TAM: The TAM for healthy energy drinks in the functional drink industry would be the total revenue generated by all energy drink companies worldwide. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global energy drink market size was valued at USD 53.01 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 86.01 billion by 2026, growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.1% from 2021 to 2026. This gives a TAM of approximately USD 86.01 billion by 2026.



- SAM: The SAM for your healthy energy drink specifically would be the portion of the TAM that your company can realistically serve given your product, marketing, and distribution capabilities. Assuming that your target market consists only of affluent women from 18-35 who are health conscious and active, the SAM would be a subset of the global energy drink market that fits this criteria. Without more detailed data on the number of such individuals worldwide, it's difficult to give an exact figure, but we can estimate that your SAM would likely be several billion dollars.



- SOM: The SOM is the actual revenue that your company could generate over a certain period of time based on your current resources and market conditions. Assuming that you have the ability to effectively market and distribute your product to your target market and capture a significant portion of their spending on energy drinks, your SOM could be in the range of several million to tens of millions of dollars annually. However, keep in mind that this estimate is highly dependent on various factors such as competition, pricing, and consumer behavior.
