Write a python script to extract all strings starting with 0x and ending with , or space in a large text string
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Here's an example Python script that uses regular expressions to extract all strings starting with 0x and ending with a comma or space character:



```python

import re



text = "This is a sample text string with 0x1234, 0xABCD, and 0xFEDF numbers in it."



pattern = r"0x[\dA-Fa-f]+[,\s]"



matches = re.findall(pattern, text)



print(matches)

```



Output:

```

['0x1234,', '0xABCD,', '0xFEDF ']

```



In this script, we first define the input text string and the regular expression pattern using the `re` module. The pattern consists of the string "0x" followed by one or more hexadecimal digits (`[\dA-Fa-f]+`) and ending with either a comma or a whitespace character (`[,\s]`).



We then use the `re.findall()` function to find all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the input text string and store them in the `matches` list. Finally, we print out the list of matched strings.



Note that this script assumes that the input text string contains only ASCII characters. If the text string contains non-ASCII characters, you may need to modify the regular expression pattern accordingly.
**USER**: the strings are ethereum wallet addresses
**ASSISTANT**: If the strings are Ethereum wallet addresses, you can modify the regular expression pattern to match valid Ethereum addresses. Here's an example Python script:



```python

import re



text = "This is a sample text string with Ethereum addresses such as 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890 and 0x0987654321098765432109876543210987654321."



pattern = r"0x[a-fA-F\d]{40}"



matches = re.findall(pattern, text)



print(matches)

```



Output:

```

['0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890', '0x0987654321098765432109876543210987654321']

```



In this script, we've modified the regular expression pattern to match valid Ethereum addresses: `0x` followed by 40 hexadecimal digits (`[a-fA-F\d]{40}`). We use the same approach as before to find all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the input text string and store them in the `matches` list.



Note that the regular expression pattern matches any sequence of 40 hexadecimal digits preceded by `0x`, regardless of whether it actually represents a valid Ethereum address or not. To ensure that the matched strings are valid Ethereum addresses, you may need to include additional checks, such as validating the checksum.
