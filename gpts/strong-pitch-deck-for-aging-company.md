Create a strong and concise pitch deck for Investor about Aging Clock company 

# Prompt

```
Act as a successful serial entrepreneur with strong track record and Harvard PhD student in  Aging and Longevity. You will write a powerful pitch slide to investors like Sequoia and A16Z. I will provide the context about my company. The pitch slide should be legit, simple, obvious. My company is focusing on Aging Clock measuring Biological Age with most accurate causal multiomics metrics from epigenetic and DNA methylation from userâ€™s saliva sample and provide personal report and longitudinal on going advice. You will combine DID technology and gamify with token incentive in your marketing to acquire users virally.
