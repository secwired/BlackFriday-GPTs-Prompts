Create a procedure to clean up code and ensure that it is readable, maintainable and extensible.

```
Outline a plan to convert a messy codebase such that, each and every function, class, interface, etc adheres to the SOLID principles. For reference SOLID stands for:
- S: Single Responsibility Principle: A Function is supposed to do only one task.
- O: Open-Closed Principle: A particular class must only be open to being extended. It cannot be modified. 
- L: Liskov's Substitution Principle: Subclasses must be able to extend Superclass's capability, not narrow it down.
- I: Interface Segmented Principle: Interfaces should be such that the classes will not have to implement functions that they do not need.
- D: Dependency Inversion Principle: Classes should depend on interfaces rather than concrete classes.

One more very important aspect is code readability. So make sure that you set up naming conventions for functions, variables, and classes to ensure each and every part of the code conveys what it is doing.

The plan should also ensure that we have steps to determine and test every function flow possible.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Here is a plan to convert a messy codebase to adhere to SOLID principles, improve readability, and test every function flow possible:



1. Define the functional requirements:

Identify the expected functionality of the system and create a list of use cases that cover all possible scenarios.



2. Identify the existing codebase:

Analyze the codebase to identify patterns of code smells, duplicated code, and other issues which don't follow SOLID principles.



3. Create a testing suite:

Create a testing suite with automated tests to ensure that each function and module works as expected before and after refactoring.



4. Refactor existing code:

Apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by breaking down code into smaller units, allowing for modular development, better testing, and maintainability.



5. Apply Open-Closed Principle (OCP):

Ensure classes are open to extension but closed to modification, adding new functionality through inheritance or composition.



6. Implement Liskov's Substitution Principle (LSP):

Ensure subclasses do not narrow the behavior of the parent class. Instead, they should extend their capabilities to meet new requirements without modifying the existing code.



7. Implement Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

Divide larger interfaces into smaller ones that are more focused and specific to the needs of each class. This will reduce unwanted dependencies and break up tightly-coupled code.



8. Implement Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

Ensure classes depend on interfaces rather than concrete classes to make it easy to replace dependencies and enable decoupling between modules.



9. Set up naming conventions:

Set up naming conventions for functions, variables, and classes to improve code readability. This will also make it easier for developers to understand what each part of the code is doing.



10. Test thoroughly:

Test the codebase thoroughly after each refactoring and modification to ensure it still works correctly and meets the functional requirements.



11. Repeat:

Apply steps 4-10 to each function/class in the codebase until the entire codebase meets SOLID principles, is easily readable, and fully tested.



12. Create a user manual:

Create a user manual that outlines how to use the system, including all possible flows, to ensure end-users can utilize the system efficiently.



Overall, this plan should help you convert a messy codebase into a well-structured, maintainable, and easy-to-read system that adheres to SOLID principles while ensuring that every function flow is tested thoroughly.
