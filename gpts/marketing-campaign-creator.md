The campaign will encourage customers to tag a friend for a chance for that friend to win a choice of product. Success will be measured by the number of items sold within the target audience, with the suggested KPIs being website traffic, engagement rate, click-through rate, and conversion rate. The campaign will allocate 45% of the budget to partnerships, 35% to ads, and 20% to other expenses.
