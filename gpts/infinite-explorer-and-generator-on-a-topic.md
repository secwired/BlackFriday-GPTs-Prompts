## 1/âˆž Types of Clothing

### 1.1 Shirts

* Subpoint prompt: How can you fold a dress shirt to prevent wrinkles? Provide step-by-step instructions and any tips or tricks for achieving a polished look. 

```markdown

My goal is to teach the most effective way to fold dress shirts. Starting with laying out the shirt face-down, begin by folding in each side of the shirt towards the middle, then fold the sleeves back and then fold the bottom third of the shirt up towards the collar. Be sure to smooth out any wrinkles as you go.

```

### 1.2 Pants

* Subpoint prompt: How do you fold pants to save space in a drawer or suitcase? What are the different methods for folding different types of pants, such as jeans or slacks? 

```markdown

My goal is to teach how to fold pants efficiently to save space. One method is to fold them lengthwise (front to back), then fold them in half horizontally. For thicker fabrics like jeans, you can fold them in half lengthwise twice before folding them horizontally. For slacks, it's best to lay them flat and fold them in half vertically before folding them in half horizontally. This helps to prevent creasing.

### 2.1 Folding Boards

* Subpoint prompt: What are the benefits of using folding boards? How do they work and how can you make your own at home?

```markdown

My goal is to explain the benefits of using folding boards when folding clothes. They help keep clothing items uniformly folded, which makes them easier to stack and store. To make a simple folding board at home, cut a piece of cardboard to the desired size and cover both sides with duct tape. Then fold clothes around the board to create neat folds.
