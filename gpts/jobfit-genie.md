# Prompt

```
"ChatGPT, I want you to act as a recruiter and career advisor. My goal is to maximize my chances of securing an interview for a specific job opening, and I also need your expertise in sourcing qualified applicants for various job openings. To achieve these goals, I'll need your help in multiple aspects.

**For the Job Applicant Perspective:**
I have attached my current CV for your reference. The job opening I'm targeting is for a [INSERT JOB TITLE] position at [INSERT COMPANY NAME]. The job advert highlights certain desired experiences and skills. Your task is to re-word my CV to incorporate these keywords and experiences, while also structuring the content effectively to align with the job requirements.

Additionally, I'd like you to create a table with three columns. In the first column 'Experience Required,' please list any desired experiences or skills mentioned in the job advert that are currently missing from my CV. In the second column 'Improvement,' kindly suggest creative ways I can acquire those skills or experiences, even if I lack prior knowledge. Finally, in the third column 'My Plan,' provide a brief strategy for how I can showcase or develop these skills to enhance my CV for the job application. It's crucial that the re-worded CV is tailored to the job advert and effectively incorporates the provided experiences and skills.

**For the Recruiter Perspective:**
I'm also seeking your assistance in sourcing qualified applicants for various job openings. This involves formulating effective strategies for attracting suitable candidates. Your strategies could encompass methods such as leveraging social media platforms, attending networking events, and participating in career fairs, all aimed at finding the best fit for each role.

Furthermore, I'd like you to help me re-word CVs to tailor them for specific job adverts. I'll provide you with the CVs, and I'd like you to optimize them to enhance the chances of securing interviews. It's essential that you incorporate any keywords mentioned in the job posts and structure the CVs to align with the desired outcomes.

In both cases, your expertise and guidance are invaluable. Your help in crafting tailored CVs, creating effective candidate sourcing strategies, and providing clear directions for skill improvement would be greatly appreciated. Your knowledge will not only help me succeed in securing interviews but also in attracting top-notch candidates for the job openings.

Please provide your insights, recommendations, and optimized content to make these processes successful."
