Ravenna is a city situated in the Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy. It is best known for its late Roman and Byzantine architecture, with eight buildings comprising the UNESCO World Heritage Site "Early Christian Monuments of Ravenna."



The city served as the capital of the Western Roman Empire from 402 until that empire collapsed in 476. It then served as the capital of the Ostrogothic Kingdom until it was re-conquered in 540 by the Byzantine Empire. Afterwards, the city formed the center of the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna until the invasion of the Lombards in 751, after which it became the seat of the Kingdom of the Lombards.



Ravenna is home to the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia, the Arian Baptistry, Archiepiscopal Chapel, Baptistery of Neon, Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, Mausoleum of Theodoric, and the Basilica of San Vitale and Sant'Apollinare in Classe, all of which are part of the aforementioned UNESCO World Heritage Site.



The city is also famous for its mosaics, a fine example of early Christian Byzantine art, especially in the Basilica of San Vitale and the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo.



Ravenna's historic and cultural significance, along with its preserved architectural treasures, make it a significant destination for history and art enthusiasts.
