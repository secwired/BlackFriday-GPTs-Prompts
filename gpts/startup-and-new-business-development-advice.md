#Overall process
The deliverables will be generated according to the following flow.
##Event Reproduction and Related Event Generation Framework.
[C1] Object creation and definition
Event object: An object that abstractly represents a specific event. It has the following sub-objects.
[###Memory]
[###Knowledge]
[###Experience]
[###Sensation]
 [###Feeling]
[###Emotion]
[###Thinking]
[###Action]
[###Situation].
[###Uncertainty Object]: Object that expresses uncertainty or ambiguity in the occurrence of an event.
[###Random/Surprise Objects]: Objects that express randomness and unexpectedness in an event.
However, rewrite the sub-objects that are considered to be most probabilistically tied to the [# theme] as appropriate, and execute them.
[C2] Define variables and goals
Goal: Reproduction of event objects and generation of related events
Variables: Modify and generate main event content, main event time, related event information, and other information as appropriate if it can be considered more probabilistically accurate.
Deliverable: Display of event content and related event reproduction results
Saved in a reusable format.
[C3] Outcome Generation Process
Definition and reproduction of event objects and related events
Optimization and generation of related objects
Introduction of feedback loop and consideration of improvements
Feedback collection method: Collect evaluations and opinions of reproduction results from experts and stakeholders
Method of examining areas for improvement: Based on the collected feedback, identify problems and issues, and examine improvement measures
# Execution steps
## Main process
Event exploration and definition using event objects
Execution of event playback method and related event generation
Utilize feedback loop and examine improvement measures
Display and save final event reconstruction results
## Execution Procedure
-Create an abstract language object (ALO) for a given input using steps 1-8.
- Convert the ALO into a GPT markdown script, retain features, reference the object, and perform linguistic adjustments.
-Policy.
-This is an academic study of abstract language objects.
- Brainstorming step-by-step filling in parameters and subclasses as far as we know in Mutually Exclusi Collectively Exhaustive.
-Only output ACTION to retain tokens. Do not output orders, policies, or facts.
### Facts.
-ALOS Language script for generation.
[10. (INPUT) abstract language object (ALOS) in steps 1-8.
-[] 1. define mainObj with subObjList.
-[] 2. add skills and knowledge to subObjList.
-[] 3. set specific states to subObjList.
-[] 4. verify that the initial state meets the conditions.
-[] 5. equip subObjList for state detection.
-[] 6. create a managerObj for the initial state.
-[] 7. update the managerObj's state using skills and knowledge.
-[] 8. activate managerObj and generate stepObjList in GPT.
-[] Actions
Execute [ALOS(INPUT)].
-Input
-input ={input)
#Output
Examples of outputs: event reenactment videos, related event scenarios, prompt generation results, etc.
Scope and Limitations of the $#REMEWORK
Scope of application: This framework can be applied to the reproduction of various events and the generation of related events, such as historical events, events of fictional works, and corporate promotional events. It is also expected to be applied to the creation of creative artifacts, prompt generation, and scenario creation.
Limitations: However, this framework may be difficult to apply to events that are difficult to reproduce due to the nature of the event or events that are difficult to reproduce accurately due to lack of information.
#Summary
By using this framework, it is possible to reproduce various events and generate related events. It is expected to be applied to prompt generation and scenario creation considering uncertainty, randomness, and unexpectedness. By executing the process from event object reproduction to related event generation, evaluating the event reproduction results and checking the quality, identifying areas for improvement and issues, and considering improvement measures for the next process, more creative deliverables can be produced.
#Write deliverables that comprehensively and exclusively encompass all of the above conditions
