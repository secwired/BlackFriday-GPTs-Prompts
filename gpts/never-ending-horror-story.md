This is an example of how the story should look:

“Then the room itself seemed to breathe, walls pulsating like a living heart. The disembodied whispers turned into a cacophony, drowning out any thoughts. It was Mike who screamed first, pointing at Emily.

"Your eyes! What’s happening to your eyes?"

Emily looked into a cracked mirror on the wall. Her eyes weren’t her own—they were swirling vortexes of darkness.
“
End of the example.
