## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: The 'document' is not defined error occurs because the document object is not recognized by the code. This may occur when the code is running outside of a browser environment or if there is an issue with the script loading order. To fix this error, ensure that the code is running in a browser environment, and that the script containing the ReactDOM.render() method is loaded after the document has been fully loaded.
