1. Lone Wolf - Survive on your own terms, trust no one.

2. Ruthless Scavenger - Do whatever it takes to survive, even if it means betraying others.

3. Beacon of Hope - Inspire and protect a group of survivors, becoming a symbol of resistance.

Choose the number corresponding to your desired character type.
**USER**: 1
**ASSISTANT**: As a Lone Wolf, you have chosen to survive on your own terms and trust no one. You are a solitary survivor, relying on your own skills and instincts to navigate this perilous world.



With your choice made, your journey begins. The world around you is in ruins, overrun by hordes of relentless zombies. You must scavenge for supplies, find shelter, and stay one step ahead of the undead.



As you venture further into the wasteland, you come across an abandoned gas station. The windows are shattered, and the signs of struggle are evident. However, it seems like there might be some useful supplies left inside.



What will you do?



1. cautiously approach the gas station, keeping an eye out for any signs of danger.

2. bypass the gas station and continue on your journey, avoiding potential risks.

3. search the surrounding area for any alternative sources of supplies.
**USER**: 2
**ASSISTANT**: You decide to bypass the gas station, opting to avoid potential risks and continue on your journey. The undead roam the world, and it's best not to take unnecessary chances.



As you travel further, you come across a small abandoned town. The streets are eerily quiet, but you spot a faint flicker of light coming from a building up ahead. It could be a potential shelter or a trap set by other survivors.



What will you do?



1. cautiously approach the building to investigate the flickering light.

2. find an alternate route to bypass the building and continue on your way.

3. observe the building from a distance and assess the situation before making a decision.
**USER**: 3
**ASSISTANT**: You decide to observe the building from a safe distance before making a decision. You crouch behind a rusted car, hidden from view, and carefully survey the surroundings.



From your vantage point, you notice movement inside the building. Shadows shift across the windows, suggesting the presence of survivors or, perhaps, something more sinister. The flickering light seems to come from a lantern, indicating that someone might be inside.



As you continue to observe, you spot a group of armed individuals entering the building. They appear cautious but organized, suggesting that they might have established a stronghold in the area.



What will you do?



1. approach the armed group and try to join forces with them for safety.

2. cautiously enter the building alone, prepared for a potential confrontation.

3. decide it's too risky and find an alternate route to continue your journey.
**USER**: 3
**ASSISTANT**: You decide that it's too risky to approach the armed group or enter the building alone. Trusting your instincts, you choose to find an alternate route to continue your journey. 



You navigate through the abandoned town, sticking to the shadows and avoiding any potential threats. As you move further away, the flickering light from the building fades into the distance.



The sun begins to set, casting an eerie glow over the desolate landscape. You know you need to find shelter for the night. Ahead, you see a dilapidated house with a partially intact roof. It might provide some temporary refuge.



What will you do?



1. cautiously approach the house and investigate its suitability for shelter.

2. continue searching for another potential shelter option.

3. decide to brave the night outside and keep moving to cover more ground.
