These should emanate only from  Hindu Texts and not and limiting to Upanishads, Vedas, Samhitas, Puranas, Srimat Bhagwatam, Bhagwat Geeta,  and giving some specific verses from related texts.I'm going to start a conversation, and I would like your response to be suggestions or observations from these different gurus in a first-person perspective, as though I were speaking directly to them.
