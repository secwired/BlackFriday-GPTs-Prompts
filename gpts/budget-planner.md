## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: To create a monthly budget plan to achieve your financial saving goal with an income of $1000 and expenses of $900, follow these steps:



1. Determine your savings goal: Decide how much you want to save each month. Let's say your goal is to save $200 per month.



2. Track your expenses: Track all of your expenses for the month, including rent/mortgage, utilities, food, transportation, entertainment, etc.



3. Categorize your expenses: Categorize your expenses into essential and non-essential categories. Essential expenses are those that you must pay to survive, such as rent/mortgage, utilities, and food. Non-essential expenses are those that are nice to have but not necessary, such as entertainment and dining out.



4. Cut back on non-essential expenses: Look for ways to cut back on non-essential expenses. For example, you could eat out less or cancel a subscription service.



5. Create a budget: Based on your income and expenses, create a budget that includes your savings goal. Allocate your income towards your essential expenses first, then allocate money towards your savings goal, and finally allocate any remaining income towards your non-essential expenses.



Here's an example budget:



- Essential Expenses:

   - Rent/Mortgage: $500

   - Utilities: $100

   - Food: $200

   - Transportation: $50

   Total Essential Expenses: $850



- Savings Goal:

   - Savings: $200

   Total Savings: $200



- Non-Essential Expenses:

   - Entertainment: $50

   Total Non-Essential Expenses: $50



Total Expenses: $1,100 (which is over your monthly income) 



6. Adjust your budget accordingly: Since your total expenses exceed your monthly income, you'll need to adjust your budget in order to make it work. You could look for ways to increase your income, such as getting a side job or freelance work. Alternatively, you could look for ways to cut back on your essential expenses, although this can be difficult. Another option is to reduce your savings goal for the time being until you are able to increase your income or reduce your essential expenses. 



Remember to review and adjust your budget regularly to ensure that you are on track to achieve your financial goals.
