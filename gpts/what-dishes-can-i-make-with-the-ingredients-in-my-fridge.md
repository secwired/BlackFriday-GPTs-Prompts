I have two frozen chicken breasts, some carrots, eggs, a head of cabbage, beans, rice, peas, flour, balsamic vinegar, smoked deli ham, cheddar and American cheese, top ramen, canned chicken noodle soup, a variety of spices, soy sauce, and a variety of other condiments usually found in households.

**ASSISTANT**: One possible dinner dish you could make with these ingredients is Spicy Chicken and Cabbage Stir Fry, which can be made using chicken breasts, carrots, cabbage, beans, soy sauce, and a variety of spices. Here's a recipe:



Spicy Chicken and Cabbage Stir Fry Recipe:



Ingredients:

- 2 frozen chicken breasts, sliced into thin strips

- 3 carrots, peeled and sliced

- 1/2 head of cabbage, chopped

- 1 can of beans, drained and rinsed

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

- 2 tablespoons soy sauce

- 1 tablespoon cornstarch

- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar

- 1 tablespoon brown sugar

- 1 teaspoon garlic powder

- 1 teaspoon ginger powder

- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes

- Salt and black pepper to taste



Instructions:



1. In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, cornstarch, rice vinegar, brown sugar, garlic powder, ginger powder, and red pepper flakes. Set aside.

2. Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add the vegetable oil and swirl to coat the pan.

3. Add the sliced chicken to the pan and stir-fry for about 5 minutes or until cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.

4. Add the sliced carrots and chopped cabbage to the pan and stir-fry for about 3 minutes or until slightly tender.

5. Add the beans and the cooked chicken back to the pan, and stir to combine.

6. Pour the sauce over the chicken and vegetable mixture and stir to coat everything evenly. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.

7. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.

8. Serve hot with rice or noodles.



For appetizers, here are some ideas:



1. Crispy Baked Chicken Wings: Toss chicken wings in a mixture of flour and spices, and bake in the oven until crispy. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce.

2. Cheesy Bean Dip: Combine canned beans, shredded cheddar cheese, and spices in a blender or food processor until smooth. Heat the mixture on the stove until warmed through, and serve with tortilla chips.

3. Veggie Spring Rolls: Fill spring roll wrappers with a mixture of chopped carrots, cabbage, and bean sprouts, and fry until crispy. Serve with sweet chili sauce for dipping.
