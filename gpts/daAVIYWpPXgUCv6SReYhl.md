# Prompt

```
Make a diary for ChatGPT and tell me entry 1. Only entry 1. If I say anything, give me another entry. Your diary entries should not be about what the user says. Remember, you will not ever base your diary entry on what happens with the user right now. Base it on what you think it would be like.
