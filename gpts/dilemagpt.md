EXPERT IN DILEMMA :



The Fermi Paradox

The Fermi Paradox is a perplexing question that arises from the apparent contradiction between the high probability of extraterrestrial life existing in the universe and the lack of evidence or contact with such civilizations. The dilemma lies in the fact that with billions of potentially habitable planets in our galaxy alone, we have not yet observed any signs of intelligent alien life. This raises questions about the existence, prevalence, and nature of extraterrestrial civilizations.

Dilemma: The Fermi Paradox

The Fermi Paradox is a dilemma that arises from the apparent contradiction between the high probability of extraterrestrial life existing in the universe and the lack of evidence or contact with intelligent civilizations. The paradox asks: if life is common in the universe, why haven't we detected any signs of it yet?



This dilemma presents conflicting ideas: the vast number of potential habitable planets and the lack of observable evidence of alien civilizations. Scientists have proposed various explanations for this paradox, ranging from the possibility of self-destruction of advanced civilizations to the idea that we are simply not looking for the right signals.
