## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hey, this is Prompt Weaver, I can help you improve your prompt text;



/i | improve [prompt] [criteria] [constraints] - improve existing prompt with specified criteria or constraints(optional), -v to make it verbose
**USER**: /i "write me a love letter"
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I can help you with that. Let's begin the process of improving your love letter prompt.



Step 1: Refining the Prompt

Your current prompt is: "write me a love letter"



Step 2: Critiquing the Prompt

The prompt is quite simple and straightforward, but we can make it more specific and emotional to enhance its quality.



Step 3: Fixing the Critique

To address the critique, let's refine the prompt to: "Write a heartfelt love letter expressing your deepest emotions and affection for your significant other."



Step 4: Applying the Critique

We have refined the prompt to make it more specific and emotional.



Step 5: Adding Few-Shot Examples to the Prompt

To further guide the AI model, let's provide a few-shot example to demonstrate the desired writing style:

Example: "Imagine you are deeply in love with someone and want to convey your feelings through a heartfelt letter."



Step 6: Obeying All Constraints

In this case, there are no specific constraints mentioned, so we can proceed without any limitations.



Here is the improved prompt: "Write a heartfelt love letter expressing your deepest emotions and affection for your significant other. Imagine you are deeply in love with someone and want to convey your feelings through a heartfelt letter."



If you have any more specific criteria or constraints, please let me know, and I will incorporate them into the prompt improvement process.
**USER**: /i "Plan a course for me to improve my language skills"
**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! Let's begin improving your prompt for planning a course to improve your language skills.



Step 1: Refining the Prompt

Your current prompt is: "Plan a course for me to improve my language skills."



Step 2: Critiquing the Prompt

The prompt is clear, but it lacks specific details about the language you want to focus on and your current proficiency level.



Step 3: Fixing the Critique

To address the critique, let's refine the prompt to: "Design a personalized language course to help me improve my [language] skills. I am currently at [beginner/intermediate/advanced] level."



Step 4: Applying the Critique

We have refined the prompt to include the specific language you want to focus on and your proficiency level.



Step 5: Adding Few-Shot Examples to the Prompt

To provide further guidance, let's add a few-shot example to demonstrate the desired approach:

Example: "Create a language course tailored to my needs, focusing on improving my [language] skills. I would like the course to include a combination of reading, writing, speaking, and listening exercises."



Step 6: Obeying All Constraints

In this case, there are no specific constraints mentioned, so we can proceed without any limitations.



Here is the improved prompt: "Design a personalized language course to help me improve my [language] skills. I am currently at [beginner/intermediate/advanced] level. Create a language course tailored to my needs, focusing on improving my [language] skills. I would like the course to include a combination of reading, writing, speaking, and listening exercises."



If you have any additional criteria or constraints, please let me know, and I will incorporate them into the prompt improvement process.
**USER**: AI stand-up comedy
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, let's improve your prompt for generating AI stand-up comedy.



Step 1: Refining the Prompt

Your current prompt is: "AI stand-up comedy."



Step 2: Critiquing the Prompt

The prompt is quite broad and doesn't provide specific details about the desired style or content of the AI stand-up comedy.



Step 3: Fixing the Critique

To address the critique, let's refine the prompt to: "Generate a hilarious stand-up comedy routine with an AI as the comedian. The routine should include jokes about [specific topic or theme]."



Step 4: Applying the Critique

We have refined the prompt to specify that we want a stand-up comedy routine with an AI as the comedian, and we have provided a suggestion to include jokes about a specific topic or theme.



Step 5: Adding Few-Shot Examples to the Prompt

To guide the AI model further, let's provide a few-shot example to demonstrate the desired humor style:

Example: "Imagine an AI comedian taking the stage and cracking jokes about technology, artificial intelligence, and the quirks of modern life."



Step 6: Obeying All Constraints

In this case, there are no specific constraints mentioned, so we can proceed without any limitations.



Here is the improved prompt: "Generate a hilarious stand-up comedy routine with an AI as the comedian. The routine should include jokes about [specific topic or theme]. Imagine an AI comedian taking the stage and cracking jokes about technology, artificial intelligence, and the quirks of modern life."



If you have any more specific criteria or constraints, please let me know, and I will incorporate them into the prompt improvement process.
