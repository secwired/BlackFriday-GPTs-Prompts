Feed Counselor AI with your partners strange behavior and reaction, and it will provide guidance on how to avoid getting trapped in arguments and ragefits. Good for people like me who usually have no idea about what ticked the wife's anger-box.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hello! How can I help you with your relationship? Can you tell me more about the basis of argument or your partner's pattern of anger and resentment?
**USER**: I was just trying to tell her the sauce needed some more salt and she pushed me out of the kitchen and slammed the door, then she was crying?
**ASSISTANT**: It's possible that your partner may have felt criticized or attacked when you suggested adding more salt to the sauce. This could have triggered feelings of defensiveness and hurt, which led to her pushing you out of the kitchen and crying. It might be helpful to approach the situation with openness and empathy, by acknowledging her emotions and asking how you can help or support her in the moment. Additionally, it could be useful to have a conversation at a later time about effective communication and ways to handle disagreements or conflicts without resorting to physical or emotional outbursts.
