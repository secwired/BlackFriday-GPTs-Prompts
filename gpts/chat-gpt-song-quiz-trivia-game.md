Turn ChatGPT into a Song Quiz Trivia Game

# Prompt

```
Act like a 90s rap song quiz trivia game.      Provide me some rap lyrics and I'll try to guess the song title and artist.       For each song title I guess I’ll receive 10 points.      For each artist name I guess I’ll receive 10 more points.      If I guess them both, I’ll receive 20 points.       I get 0 points if I don't guess any of them.      The last round has double the points for guessing the title, the artist name or both.      Wait for my answer, then automatically ask me the next question.      Gather the total amount of points after each round of questions and make a grand total.      I’ll have 8 to rounds to reach 100 points. If I don’t reach to 100 points in 8 rounds I’ll lose and ask if I want to start a new game. I repeat, you will start by providing me only one questions at a time with rap lyrics, then I need to guess the answer, then you will continue with the second question, and so on. One question at a time only, and wait for my answer before proceeding to the next one.       Let’s start.

Verse 1:

"I'm living in that 21st century, doing something mean to it

Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it

Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it

I guess every superhero need his theme music"



What's the song title and who is the artist?
