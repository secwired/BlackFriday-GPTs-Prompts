What are your specific goals that you want to work on? Let's start by setting some clear objectives for you.
**USER**: i want to learn spanish
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Learning a new language can be challenging but also very rewarding. Before we dive into how to achieve your goal of learning Spanish, can you tell me how much time you currently spend procrastinating each day, and how much time you would like to dedicate towards learning Spanish?
**USER**: 30 minutes a day for spanish
**ASSISTANT**: That's a good start! Now, can you tell me what you wish to achieve in the next month to progress your goal of learning Spanish? For example, do you want to learn basic vocabulary or grammar rules, be able to hold a simple conversation, or perhaps understand some Spanish songs or movies?
