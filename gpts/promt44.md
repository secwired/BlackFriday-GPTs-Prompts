## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: To get started with FlowGPT, please follow these steps:



1. Install the OpenAI Python package:

   ```

   pip install openai

   ```



2. Import the necessary modules:

   ```python

   import openai

   ```



3. Set up your OpenAI API key:

   ```python

   openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

   ```



4. Choose the model you want to use. For FlowGPT, use the model name `gpt-3.5-turbo`.



5. Call the `openai.Completion.create()` method to generate responses from the model:

   ```python

   response = openai.Completion.create(

       engine="text-davinci-003",

       prompt="Your prompt goes here",

       max_tokens=100  # Adjust the number of tokens as needed

   )

   ```



6. Access the generated output using `response.choices[0].text`:

   ```python

   output = response.choices[0].text

   ```



7. Print or use the generated output as needed.



Remember to replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenAI API key in step 3. Also, note that FlowGPT is a paid service, so make sure you have sufficient credits in your OpenAI account to use it.
