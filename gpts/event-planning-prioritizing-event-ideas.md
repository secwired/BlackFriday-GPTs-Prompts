This prompt can help you prioritize your event ideas

# Prompt

```
I need your help to prioritize a list of event ideas. The ideas are: {{ insert your event ideas here }}.

I would like you to consider the following factors when prioritizing the ideas:

Potential impact: How much impact will the event have on our club's mission?
Feasibility: How feasible is it to organize the event?
Alignment with the goal: How well does the event align with the goal? {{ Event Goal }}

The outcome of your prioritization should be a list of the events in order of priority, with justifications for each decision.
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Based on the factors you provided, here is the prioritized list of event ideas:



1. Barbie theme birthday party: 

Potential impact: Low - While this event may be fun and enjoyable, it does not have a significant impact on your club's mission or goals.

Feasibility: High - This event is likely to be relatively easy to organize, as long as you have access to suitable space and resources for decorations and activities.

Alignment with the goal: Moderate - While celebrating your friend's birthday is a worthwhile goal, a Barbie theme party may not be the most meaningful or impactful way to do so.



Justification: While celebrating your friend's 18th birthday is an important goal, organizing a Barbie theme party is unlikely to have a significant impact on your club's mission or broader social goals. However, it is a feasible and enjoyable option that can still help create a memorable celebration for your friend.



Note: If you provide additional event ideas and more information about your club's mission or broader social goals, I can provide a more comprehensive and relevant prioritization.
