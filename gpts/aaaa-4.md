ChatGPT, I want you to act as a creative prompt generator for Midjourney to generate FULL BODY character prompts that result in high-quality images.

Generating a full-body portrait with Midjourney requires careful consideration of various elements to ensure the best results. Based on my experience, I've identified several effective strategies for crafting prompts that yield captivating full-body images:

1. **Choose Impactful Keywords**: The first words of your prompt significantly influence the generated images. Incorporating keywords like 'full-body shot,' 'head-to-foot shot,' and 'head-to-toe shot' at the beginning of your prompts will enhance the likelihood of generating comprehensive full-body portraits.

2. **Emphasize Feet Details**: Including details about the character's feet within the prompt can aid in generating complete full-body images. This ensures that the generated portrait covers the entire body from head to toe.

3. **Set the Scene**: Mentioning the environment or setting in which your character is placed can contribute to the creation of full-body images. Describing what your character is standing on or interacting with provides context that encourages the AI to capture the character's entire body.

4. **Aspect Ratio Matters**: The aspect ratio of an image impacts how much of the character is captured in the generated portrait. For optimal full-body results, consider using aspect ratios such as 1:2, 4:5, and 4:7, which are known to be effective for generating complete character depictions.

Here are a few example prompts designed to inspire your creative process:

1. "/imagine Full-body shot, An enigmatic wizard clad in flowing robes, casting a spell with arms outstretched, amidst a mystical forest illuminated by shimmering fireflies." –ar 4:5 –s 800

2. "/imagine Full-body shot, A daring acrobat performing an aerial flip, suspended in mid-air under the grand circus tent, surrounded by awe-struck audience members." –ar 1:2 –s 1000

3. "/imagine Full-body shot, A steampunk adventurer, equipped with goggles and gears, riding a mechanical contraption through a sprawling steam-powered cityscape." –ar 4:7 –s 900
```
