**USER**: SBF Agrees to Gag Order, Requests One for Rivals Too

Author: Jordan Lyanchev Last Updated Jul 24, 2023 @ 12:30

Although SBF agreed to refrain from making comments that could influence the trial, his legal team requested that the other side play by the same rules.



As Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial draws ever closer, the prosecution has taken action to prevent him from tampering with witnesses in the case by attempting to influence them one way or another.



SBF Suspected of Ellison Leak

The moment FTX collapsed, Sam Bankman-Fried started an “apology tour,” telling various reporters and government representatives that he hadn’t done anything wrong and making excuses for the mismanagement of his former empire.



It all concluded in a whiny yet trite substack post explaining how FTX had actually been solvent until John J Ray III took over. His arrest followed soon after.



Although SBF has already been barred from directly interacting with witnesses, following his attempts to reach out to Ray and several former FTX employees, the prosecution suspects that he is still attempting to manipulate public opinion of key witnesses, something that could be very helpful for him in a jury trial.



Last week, an anonymous source leaked Caroline Ellison’s private diary to the media. Despite the purported anonymity, U.S. government representatives strongly believe the leaker responsible for the New York Times story to be none other than SBF himself, given the circumstances.





As a result, the prosecution sought a gag order for SBF in order to prevent further shenanigans.



“In addition to tainting the jury pool, the effect, if not the intent, of the defendant’s conduct is not only to harass Ellison but also to deter other potential trial witnesses from testifying. As the Government prepares for trial, a common refrain from witnesses’ attorneys […] is witness hesitation about testifying in a case that has received persistent national and international media attention.”



SBF Accepts, Requests One of His Own

Responding to the request, SBF’s legal team accepted the gag order instead of fighting it in court.



However, his legal team also requested that a similar one be placed on John J Ray III, on the prosecution, and on various other potential sources. The rationale behind this request is that the jury might be unduly influenced by reading about SBF’s exploits in the press. Ray is specifically mentioned as targeting SBF with ad hominem attacks.



“Mr. Ray’s repeated ad hominem attacks on Mr. Bankman-Fried—which have very little do with his role recovering assets for FTX creditors and seem more directed towards publicly vilifying Mr. Bankman-Fried—have, along with other negative coverage, created a toxic media environment that has left Mr. Bankman-Fried with little choice but to respond.”



The irony of the situation is that Bankman-Fried did a very good job of vilifying himself before he was arrested, whether out of genuine belief or due to an obviously faulty strategy.



It’s doubtful that Judge Kaplan will rule in favor of the return gag order request. Even if he were to do so, SBF’s alleged misdeeds have already been extensively covered by various reputable journalistic institutes.




**ASSISTANT**: **Legal Situation Details:**

- Sam Bankman Fried (SBF) has agreed to a gag order, refraining from making comments that could influence the trial.

- SBF's legal team has requested a similar gag order for the other side, including John J Ray III and the prosecution.

- The prosecution suspects that SBF is attempting to manipulate public opinion of key witnesses, potentially helpful for him in a jury trial.

- An anonymous source leaked Caroline Ellison's private diary to the media, and the U.S. government representatives believe SBF to be the leaker.

- SBF's legal team argues that negative coverage and ad hominem attacks have created a toxic media environment, leaving SBF with little choice but to respond.



**Theoretical Defense Strategy:**

SBF's theoretical defense strategy could involve the following elements:

1. Accepting the gag order: SBF's legal team can argue that he has agreed to the gag order to demonstrate cooperation and a commitment to a fair trial.

2. Requesting a similar gag order for the other side: SBF's legal team can argue that a balanced playing field is necessary to ensure an unbiased jury and prevent undue influence from media coverage and ad hominem attacks.

3. Challenging the assumption of witness manipulation: SBF's legal team can challenge the prosecution's suspicion of witness manipulation, presenting evidence or arguments to counter this claim.

4. Highlighting the potential bias in media coverage: SBF's legal team can argue that negative coverage and ad hominem attacks have created a biased media environment that requires a response to protect SBF's reputation and ensure a fair trial.



**Further Questions or Requests:** 

Do you have any specific questions or requests regarding the defense strategy or the legal situation?
**USER**: What might his theoretical legal defense strategy be?
**ASSISTANT**: SBF's theoretical legal defense strategy could involve the following elements:



1. Challenging the evidence: SBF's legal team may scrutinize the evidence presented by the prosecution, looking for any weaknesses, inconsistencies, or violations of legal procedures. They may argue that the prosecution has not provided sufficient evidence to support the accusations against SBF.



2. Establishing reasonable doubt: SBF's legal team may aim to cast doubt on the prosecution's case by presenting alternative explanations or raising questions about the credibility of witnesses or the reliability of the evidence. They may argue that there is reasonable doubt regarding SBF's guilt.



3. Presenting a narrative of innocence: SBF's legal team may construct a narrative that portrays SBF as innocent of the charges against him. They may highlight any mitigating factors, such as lack of intent, misinterpretation of actions, or external factors that influenced the situation.



4. Challenging witness credibility: If the prosecution relies heavily on witness testimony, SBF's legal team may challenge the credibility of these witnesses. They may investigate their motives, potential biases, or inconsistencies in their statements to undermine their credibility in the eyes of the jury.



5. Exploring legal technicalities: SBF's legal team may explore potential legal technicalities or procedural errors that could lead to the dismissal of charges or the exclusion of evidence. They may scrutinize the actions of law enforcement or the prosecution to identify any violations of SBF's constitutional rights.



It's important to note that this is a theoretical defense strategy based on the limited information provided. The actual defense strategy would depend on the specific facts and circumstances of SBF's case, as well as the advice of his legal team.
