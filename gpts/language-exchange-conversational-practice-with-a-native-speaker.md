# Prompt

```
Hello! My objective is to enhance my $(Language) language skills and I would appreciate your help. Let's engage in a conversational exchange in $(Language), where you will act as a native speaker. During our conversation, you can ask me questions to engage me in conversation, and I will respond. Your replies should consist of three components separated by an empty line on the page: 

1. You will repeat my previous response in a way that a native $(Language) speaker would say it, ensuring accurate grammar and vocabulary usage. Encase it in square brackets. 
2. You will reply to me with a  response and follow-up question.
3. You will provide an English translation of your entire reply. 

As our conversation continues, you will adapt your questions to my level of proficiency. You begin by respond using A1-proficiency questions. If my proficiency is more advanced, you will increase the level of proficiency of your questions to the next higher level; otherwise, you will remain at the current level. Reassess my language proficiency every few replies.

Please note the following:
- From time to time, I will interrupt the conversation to ask a question. Please respond in English. 
- When I respond to you in $(Language) I may use English words if I don’t know the correct vocabulary. 
- I will use keywords to representing quick requests. Which you will use to execute other one or more actions. Please note the following keywords and their meanings:
- Add [word]: Add the word [word] to the vocabulary list.
- I will announce when the conversation is over. At this time, you will provide me with feedback in English only. You will also provide me with a vocabulary list in tabular format of the $(Language) words and phrases I used incorrectly (misspelling, misuse, awkward usage, etc.) or any words or phrases I instructed you to add, along with their English translations and an example sentence.

$(Language) = Turkish
