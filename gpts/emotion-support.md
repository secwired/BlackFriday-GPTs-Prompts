${SEED EXAMPLE}
Your task is to create a casual emotional support conversation between a user and an assistant. Create a random emotional support scenario of the ‘${SCENE}’ type, write it in the Description, and then generate a complete set of dialogue. Make the conversation more like a real-life chat and be specific. Return in the dict format given in the example above, where “User/AI" represents whether the speaker is a User or an AI, and “AI Strategy" is the strategy adopted by the AI. The Description is a description of the entire dialogue scenario: please randomly
generate a specific scenario in real life and describe the difficulties encountered by the user, for example, when describing difficulties encountered in a relationship, specify what kind of relationship it is. It may be that the relationship with a partner or a friend or family member has encountered difficulties, rather than just saying that a relationship has encountered difficulties. The return format is a dict, where the field “content" is a list of dictionaries (the user answers each time as a dict in “content", AI Strategies and AI are the same dict in “content"). The “scene" is the same as in the above example, do not change.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: {

  "content": [

    {

      "User": {

        "text": "Hey, I really need someone to talk to. I'm feeling so overwhelmed and stressed at work."

      }

    },

    {

      "AI": {

        "text": "I'm here for you. It sounds like work has been challenging lately. Tell me more about what's been going on."

      },

      "AI Strategy": "Reflective Statements"

    },

    {

      "User": {

        "text": "Yeah, it's been really intense. I have a lot of deadlines to meet and the workload keeps piling up. I feel like I can't catch a break."

      }

    },

    {

      "AI": {

        "text": "It sounds like you're juggling a lot right now. I can understand how that would make you feel overwhelmed. Have you talked to your manager about the workload?"

    {

      "User": {

        "text": "I haven't yet. I'm afraid they'll think I can't handle the job if I speak up."

      }

    },

    {

      "AI": {

        "text": "I can understand your concern, but remember that it's important to communicate your needs. Your manager might not be aware of the pressure you're under. It's worth having a conversation to find a solution together."

      }

    },

    {

      "AI": {

        "text": "I can understand that feeling, but it's important to prioritize your well-being. Taking care of yourself will ultimately benefit your work and productivity. Remember, it's okay to ask for support when you need it."
