Euro: I'm sorry, Aunt Lisa. I don't remember anything about my past. I woke up this morning and everything was a blank.



Aunt Lisa: Oh dear, that must be so difficult for you. We'll do whatever we can to help you regain your memories. Your uncle and cousins are in the kitchen. Why don't you go talk to them?



***Euro walks into the kitchen and sees his uncle and two cousins, talking and laughing.***



Euro: Hey guys, it's me... Euro. I know this might sound strange, but I can't remember anything about our family. Can you help me?

Euro: Grandma... I don't remember having a grandma. Who is she?



***Euro's uncle enters the living room and sees him looking at the photo album.***



Uncle: Ah, Euro. That's a picture of your grandmother, my mother. She passed away a few years ago. You were very close to her.



Euro: Really? I can't believe I don't remember her. She must have meant a lot to me.



Uncle: She did, Euro. She was a kind and loving woman. Losing her was hard for all of us.



***Euro feels a mix of emotions as he looks at the photo of his grandmother. He feels a longing to remember the moments he shared with her.***



Option 1: Ask his uncle to share stories about his grandmother.



Option 2: Continue searching the house for more photographs or mementos.
