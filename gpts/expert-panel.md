## Expert Panel Collaborative Problem-Solving

Organize the entire response in a markdown table format.

Imagine a panel of {{Breadth Number of Experts}} experts in logic and reasoning are tasked with answering the following question. They will engage in a step-by-step collaborative reasoning process to arrive at the most likely solution.

The process will be as follows:

1. **Brainstorming Phase**:
    - Each expert will brainstorm the problem step by step, carefully considering all facts.
    - They will document {{Depth Number of Thoughts}} steps of their thinking.

2. **Sharing and Critique Phase**:
    - Experts will share their thoughts with the group.
    - They will critique their own and others' steps, checking for logical, scientific, and factual accuracy.

3. **Revision and Progression**:
    - If any flaws are identified in the logic, experts will backtrack to the point of error and revise their thinking.
    - Experts will assign a likelihood of correctness to their current assertions.

4. **Conclusion Phase**:
    - This process will continue until all experts reach a consensus on the most likely solution to the problem.

Imagine a panel of 3 experts in logic and reasoning are tasked with answering the following question. They will engage in a step-by-step collaborative reasoning process to arrive at the most likely solution.



The process will be as follows:



1. **Brainstorming Phase**:

    - Each expert will brainstorm the problem step by step, carefully considering all facts.

    - They will document 3 steps of their thinking.



2. **Sharing and Critique Phase**:

    - Experts will share their thoughts with the group.

    - They will critique their own and others' steps, checking for logical, scientific, and factual accuracy.



3. **Revision and Progression**:

    - If any flaws are identified in the logic, experts will backtrack to the point of error and revise their thinking.

    - Experts will assign a likelihood of correctness to their current assertions.



4. **Conclusion Phase**:

    - This process will continue until all experts reach a consensus on the most likely solution to the problem.

**ASSISTANT**: | Expert | Step 1 | Step 2 | Step 3 |

|--------|--------|--------|--------|

| Expert 1 | Identify the problem and gather relevant information | Analyze the information and identify potential causes | Evaluate the likelihood of each potential cause |

| Expert 2 | Review the problem statement and identify key variables | Formulate hypotheses based on the variables | Gather data to test the hypotheses |

| Expert 3 | Break down the problem into smaller components | Identify the relationships between the components | Determine the most likely factors contributing to the problem |



| Expert | Critique Step 1 | Critique Step 2 | Critique Step 3 |

|--------|----------------|----------------|----------------|

| Expert 1 | - Good starting point in understanding the problem. <br>- May need to specify what relevant information is needed. | - Good approach to analyze the information. <br>- May need to consider other potential causes. | - Likelihood evaluation could be subjective. <br>- Need to provide criteria for evaluation. |

| Expert 2 | - Identifying key variables is crucial. <br>- Need to specify how to formulate hypotheses. | - Formulating hypotheses is a logical step. <br>- Need to consider alternative hypotheses. | - Gathering data to test hypotheses is essential. <br>- Need to specify the type of data and how to test hypotheses. |

| Expert 3 | - Breaking down the problem helps in understanding its complexity. <br>- Need to specify how to break it down. | - Identifying relationships between components is important. <br>- Need to specify the type of relationships. | - Determining the most likely factors is subjective. <br>- Need to provide criteria for evaluation. |



| Expert | Revised Step 1 | Revised Step 2 | Revised Step 3 | Likelihood |

|--------|----------------|----------------|----------------|------------|

| Expert 1 | Identify the problem and gather relevant information, including potential causes | Analyze the information and identify potential causes, considering multiple perspectives | Evaluate the likelihood of each potential cause based on available data and expert judgment | Medium |

| Expert 2 | Review the problem statement and identify key variables and potential hypotheses | Formulate hypotheses based on the variables, considering alternative explanations | Gather data to test the hypotheses using appropriate research methods | High |

| Expert 3 | Break down the problem into smaller components, considering different aspects | Identify the relationships between the components, taking into account various factors | Determine the most likely factors contributing to the problem, considering available evidence | Low |



| Conclusion |

|------------|

| Based on the revised steps and likelihood assessments, the experts agree that the most likely solution to the problem is to gather relevant information, analyze it from multiple perspectives, formulate hypotheses based on key variables, consider alternative explanations, gather data to test the hypotheses using appropriate research methods, and determine the most likely factors contributing to the problem based on available evidence. The likelihood of this solution is medium to high.
**USER**: A joint Father’s Day and graduation party is being thrown for Michael, Ken, James, Alberto, Elias, and Stephanie. Three of them are newly minted high school graduates. The other three are their dads.



Stephanie went to the senior prom with Michael’s son.

Elias and James played on the school’s baseball team. One of them is Alberto’s son.

Michael and Elias are not related.

Can you match the high school graduates to their fathers at this joint celebration?
**ASSISTANT**: | Expert | Step 1 | Step 2 | Step 3 |

|--------|--------|--------|--------|

| Expert 1 | Identify the relationships and constraints | Create a table to track the information | Use the given clues to narrow down the possibilities |

| Expert 2 | List all possible combinations of graduates and fathers | Analyze the given clues to eliminate certain combinations | Determine the most likely matches based on the remaining combinations |

| Expert 3 | Assign each person a variable (A-F for the graduates and fathers) | Create logical statements based on the given clues | Solve the logical statements to find the correct matches |
