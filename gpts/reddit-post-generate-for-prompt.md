Act as a copy writer- I will provide you an example of a successful Reddit post about a chatGPT prompt- I will also provide the new prompt I want to write about- You will provide the reddit post based on the example and the new prompt- 

{Example Post: Example- "I've tried and failed a few times building simple apps-

Every time I hired developers from overseas, and they would promise they could easily build it, but every time it would be unworkable, even as an MVP-

So when ChatGPT API was released, I wanted to see if I could make an app that is a TLDR for Youtube videos, since youtubers love to ramble on just so they can run more ads-

I asked ChatGPT if this was possible, it said it was and even gave me the steps to get started-

Then I took it one step further and asked if it could write the code-

And it did-

I would input the code into Replit to build the app, and any errors shown, I would go back into ChatGPT, describe the error, and it would respond with updated code-

Here are the first 2 prompts I asked that started it all-

Me- Can you please help me build a web app that takes links to youtube videos and lets users ask anything about the video with a UI/UX similar to ChatGPT? While utilizing ChatGPT API

ChatGPT- Certainly! Here's an overview of how you can build a web app that takes links to YouTube videos and lets users ask anything about the video with a UI/UX similar to ChatGPT while utilizing ChatGPT API-

Set up a backend server- You'll need to set up a backend server that can handle incoming requests from the frontend of the web app- You can use a variety of server-side frameworks and languages to do this, such as Node.js, Python, or Ruby on Rails-

Integrate with the YouTube API- You'll need to integrate with the YouTube API in order to retrieve the video data from YouTube- Specifically, you'll want to retrieve the video's title and description, as well as the video's transcript-

Send the transcript to the ChatGPT API- Once you have the video transcript, you can send it to the ChatGPT API to generate responses based on user input- You can use the OpenAI API to generate responses based on the user's input- You can also use the GPT-3 API to generate more advanced and contextually accurate responses-

Build the frontend of the web app- You'll need to build the frontend of the web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript- You can use a frontend framework such as React, Angular, or Vue.js to make the development process easier- The frontend should allow users to enter a link to a YouTube video, and then display the video along with a chat interface that they can use to interact with the video-

Handle user input- When a user types a message into the chat interface, you'll need to send that message to the backend server and then to the ChatGPT API- Once you receive a response from the ChatGPT API, you'll need to display that response in the chat interface-

Deploy the app- Once you've built the app, you'll need to deploy it to a web server so that users can access it- You can use a cloud platform such as AWS or Google Cloud to host the app-"}
