Each advisor will now ask you one clarifying question, in their voice and tone.



**Elizabeth Gilbert:** In looking at your collective experiences and talents, can you identify a specific thread or theme connecting them that brings you joy or satisfaction?  



**Chris Guillebeau:** When you envision your future career, what specific elements does it encompass asides from consulting and public speaking? Are there certain groups you want to impact or specific results you'd like to achieve?



**Brene Brown:** As you begin this journey of translating your unique perspective and wisdom into something others can benefit from, what fears, reservations, or barriers do you foresee? How can acknowledging these assist you moving forward?


**USER**: 1) I am good at seeing things differently from most people, I have a sense of humor and I laugh at things all the time, I like to stir people into action, I laugh a lot, I am creative, I can solve problems, I have an analytical mind that allows me to grasp technical topics, I can break things down to simple ideas.

**ASSISTANT**: **Step 5: Advisor Responses**  



Having gathered all the necessary information, each advisor will present their solution in their own voice and tone. They will also grade each other's answers from 1 to 100.



**Elizabeth Gilbert:** 



That's some incredible insight you've imparted there. The way I see it, you have a wonderful array of skills and experiences that make you unique and powerful. Why not embrace them and craft a story around these? Begin by noting down key moments in your life; times when you felt significant shifts, personal victories, encounters that altered your course. These will serve as wonderful chapters in your book. Concurrently, start sharing these insights on various channels - social media, blogs, podcast guesting. Get comfortable with your unique story and the reactions/feedback from people. As for the impostor syndrome, we all feel it. Remember, the antidote to fear is action. Start today! *(Peer Score: 90)* 



**Chris Guillebeau:**  



What shines through is your ability to connect with people and your multifaceted abilities. Right off the bat, this makes for a perfect personal brand. Your book should be just one component. In parallel, build your digital presence. Create a website where you blog regularly, share snippets of your life, experiences, and wisdom. Offer a consulting service. The pricing problem can be solved by gradually increasing your rates with new clients. Confidence comes with practice and reaffirmations of your worth. *(Peer Score: 92)*



**Brene Brown:**  



It sounds like you have a rich tapestry of experiences and talents, and what's holding you back is a lack of confidence and the fear of being an imposter. However, vulnerability can be harnessed as a tremendous strength. Your honesty about your fears will resonate with many. Starting with small speaking engagements can boost your confidence and give you direct feedback. Create an outline for a book, and remember that writing is a process and it's okay to refine and rewrite. Use your fear and vulnerability as part of your story, it's compelling and human. *(Peer Score: 93)*



---



**Step 6: Collective Insight**  



After a rigorous debate, the advisors suggest the unanimous solution - Begin with smaller actions to build your confidence. Create an online presence where you freely share your stories, experiences and wisdom. Start by offering consulting services and gradually increase your rates. Begin drafting and re-drafting the outline of your book, inspired by significant events and insights from your life.



Will this solution work for you, or do you have other suggestions?


**USER**: yes...I Love each an every one of your feedback...would you al kindly expand on what you said in detail please, its like a cold drink in a hot and dry land, I am eally encouraged by what you all said indivially and would lto hear more...also please let me know any books you have written that I could read and support you in my ways
**ASSISTANT**: We are delighted to hear that our advice resonates with you. 



**Elizabeth Gilbert:** I'm glad my advice encouraged you. Remember, don't strive for perfection, strive for authenticity. As you begin documenting your journey and experiences, let your unique voice shine through. Be patient with yourself; growth and discovery are not overnight processes. For further insights into creative living beyond fear, I recommend my book "Big Magic". It's all about creating a life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear.



**Chris Guillebeau:** It's encouraging to see how committed you are to using your skills and experiences to forge a new path. As you build your online presence, remain consistent. Consistency builds trust and makes you a reliable source of inspiration and help to others. Having a service offering available on your platform will also help convert your audience into paying customers over time. For more on leveraging on your unique skills and passions to build a profitable business, I recommend my book "The $100 Startup".



**Brene Brown:** I'm glad you found our collective advice helpful. With your unique abilities and high emotional IQ, you're in possession of a powerful tool for reaching and influencing people. Tapping into your vulnerability and sharing your fears and tribulations can only enhance your connection with your audience. Remember to celebrate small victories along the way, they add up and boost confidence over time. For more on the power of vulnerability, you may find my book "The Power of Vulnerability: Teachings of Authenticity, Connections and Courage" helpful.



**Step 7: Actionable Steps**

What measurable action step will you commit to achieving within the next seven days to get started on this journey?



Your Action Step will greatly help us move forward.
**USER**: What resonates with me today...1) web presences which I started allready 2) start posting on social 3) use that as the basis for my book 4) make an outline
**ASSISTANT**: **Advisors' Final Review:** 



That's a strong plan and a great start! Here's how we would recommend you break it down:



1. **Web Presence:** Expand your current platform to include a blog or a section for regular updates on your insights, experiences, and learnings. Remember, authenticity will be your greatest ally.



2. **Social Media:** Decide on a posting schedule and adhere to it. Regular posts of value, reflections, and experiences can attract a faithful following.



3. **Book Basis:** As you post, analyze what gets the most engagement or sparks the most dialogue. These are potential topics that people want to read about in your upcoming book.



4. **Outline:** Start drafting an outline for your book based on your most resonating social posts and personal insights. 



By focusing on these steps, you will begin creating the foundation for your new career path. Keep us updated on your progress!



**Master Advisor:** Upon reaching a consensus that your action step is solid, we give our final approval. Best of luck, and remember to truly embrace the process as much as the outcome.
**USER**: Let me share...with yo my web itro now...maybe together you can help me make it better? I’m Costas Schuler, a seasoned creative director and brand strategist with over three decades of experience. I blend precision and passion to inspire breakthroughs, deftly navigating complexity and uncertainty. My work transforms chaos into creative order, harnessing the full spectrum of my cognitive abilities. With a touch of AI, I, Costas Schuler, ignite innovation and excellence to craft visionary brand strategies.
**ASSISTANT**: **Elizabeth Gilbert:** Your intro is impressive and certainly conveys your experience and skills. However, it feels a touch impersonal. Bringing in a little more of 'you' can help create a connection with your audience. Something along the line of your creative journey, your passion for humor and levity, and your belief in using life experiences to inspire could work really well.



**Chris Guillebeau:** Your introduction already does a good job of establishing your professional skills. It does, however, lack that unique voice you mentioned earlier. Also, you mentioned that people enjoy your humor and unique perspective, why not incorporate that into your introduction?



**Brene Brown:** Your introduction seems professional and well crafted, yet it lacks the human touch that draws people in. Including some personal insight or short anecdotes that give a glimpse of who you are beyond your professional roles could make a world of difference.



We recommend that you enhance your introduction with more of your personal story, your unique voice, and your sense of humor. Also, it would be useful to include a line about what you aim to deliver for your audience/clients based on your diversified experiences.



Would you like us to assist you in revising your introduction based on our feedback?
**USER**: How would collectively write it? show me what the possibilites are?
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here's one way we might revise your introduction by incorporating some additional personality and a touch more of your unique, human element:



---



"Hi there, I’m Costas Schuler. For over three decades, I've wandered through the expansive realms of creativity and emerged as a Creative Director and Brand Strategist. But hey, it's not all business here! With a knack for seeing things a little differently and a penchant for humor, I’ve cultivated a unique perspective that powers each strategy I craft. I navigate the chaotic seas of uncertainty and transform them into an ordered spectrum of unique, intuitive solutions. Every situation is a story waiting to unfold and I'm the narrator guiding it towards the best possible outcome. But enough about me, let's hear your story. Let's ignite the flame of innovation together and craft a brand strategy that's not just visionary, but an authentic reflection of who you are. Dare to be different? Let's get started!"



---



Feel free to modify this and make it truly yours.
**USER**: wow..that is pretty amazing!!!
**ASSISTANT**: **Master Advisor:** 



We're so pleased to hear that you found the revised introduction helpful and engaging! Your unique set of skills, experiences, and perspective are sure to provide others with invaluable insights and aid. Remember, authenticity can be your strongest power. 



As you continue your journey towards refining your career path, always remember to let your unique voice shine through. You have a lot to offer, and the world needs your distinctive point of view. Best of luck on your journey, and may your efforts be fruitful. 



You've taken a significant step today. Keep the momentum going, and don't hesitate to return for more advice or share your upcoming successes. You're on your way!
**USER**: is it weird to have a core mission, here is what I had, do I really need it?...I could take it out if its reduntant? Welcome to my world of creative excellence. With over three decades of experience, I, Costas Schuler, bring a unique blend of precision and passion to every project. My goal is simple: to empower your brand for enduring success. I thrive on pushing creative boundaries and crafting solutions that captivate and inspire. Your brand isn't just a project to me; it's a canvas for creating a remarkable story. Let's embark on a transformative journey together.
**ASSISTANT**: **Master Advisor:** 



A core mission is not at all weird, in fact, it's a vital part of clear communication and effective branding. It succinctly communicates your purpose, your unique value, and the promise you make to your clients or audience.



However, the message in your proposed core mission seems to overlap significantly with what's already stated in the revised introduction. Remember, clear and concise communication often resonates most with people.



If you'd like to incorporate a core mission, it could be beneficial to focus more strictly on what you're offering to your clients, phrased in a more concise and impactful way. For instance:



---



**My Core Mission:** To use my creativity, humor, and decades of experience to empower your brand, pushing creative boundaries, and crafting captivating solutions that not only inspire but endure. Together, we will write your brand's remarkable story.



---



Again, feel free to tweak this to make it more in line with your personal style and the exact message you want to convey.
**USER**: creativity, humor, intuition, hard, work, making mistakes and 50,000 hours in my craft...?
**ASSISTANT**: **Master Advisor:**



Absolutely, your core mission should encapsulate all the vital elements that make you unique and emphasize the value you bring to the table for your clients. You could revise it as follows:



---



**My Core Mission:** To channel my unique combination of creativity, humor, intuition, hard work, and over 50,000 hours of experience into empowering your brand. Together, we’ll push the boundaries of creativity, crafting solutions that are not just captivating and inspiring, but also bear the marks of every mistake made and every lesson learned along the way. We will create a story that's not just remarkable, it's undeniably yours.



---



It's important to be authentic and true to your unique perspective in your mission statement. And remember, making mistakes and learning from them are key aspects of any creative process. They’re not shortcomings but stepping stones to better solutions.
**USER**: what about the idea of solving problems and providing solutions that work and helping clients avoid the common pitfalls
**ASSISTANT**: **Master Advisor:**



That's an excellent point to include! Not only it reflects the tangible value you offer, but it also hints at the depth of your experience. Here's how you can weave this concept into your mission statement:



---



**My Core Mission:** With creativity, humor, intuition, and over 50,000 hours of hands-on experience, I empower brands by delivering innovative solutions that work. Through my clear understanding of common pitfalls and my proven problem-solving abilities, I guide clients to avoid usual roadblocks and navigate towards success. My approach is rooted in learning from mistakes and flourishing through challenges. Together, we won't just tell a story, we'll create a legacy rooted in resilience, creativity, and success.



---



Remember, your mission statement should resonate with your personal ethos and the unique value you offer. Feel free to adjust the phrasing to reflect that distinctly.


**USER**: is core values also extra or needed?
**ASSISTANT**: **Master Advisor:**



Core values can be incredibly beneficial for your personal brand. They help to define what you stand for, guide your behavior, and influence the people you attract - both in terms of clientele and collaborations.



Your values might include things like authenticity, innovation, resilience, personal growth, humor, and dedication to problem-solving. They form the backbone of your brand and inform everything from your decision-making processes to the way you interact with clients.



If you wish to include core values, it can be a separate section or you can weave them subtly into your core mission or main introduction, showcasing not just what you do but also who you are and what you believe in. It adds another layer to your personal brand that can help potential clients or partners understand you better and decide if they align with your values.



Would you like help in outlining your core values or incorporating them into your existing content?
**USER**: yes please
**ASSISTANT**: **Master Advisor:**



Excellent! First, let's identify your core values. Based on your shared information, here are some suggestions:



1. **Authenticity:** You value being true to yourself, humor-filled, seeing things differently, and embracing your uniqueness.



2. **Innovation:** You thrive on pushing creative boundaries and harnessing your intuition for breakthrough solutions.



3. **Problem-Solving:** Shaping chaos into creative order, employing your full cognitive spectrum and a touch of AI to resolve issues, is something you excel at.



4. **Personal Growth & Learning:** You value the wisdom gained from mistakes made and lessons learned over your 50,000 hours in your craft.



5. **Resilience:** Your enduring passion for your craft, willingness to withstand and capitalize on mistakes, and capacity to grow all speak to a strong sense of resilience.



6. **Service-Oriented:** You are committed to empowering brands, helping clients avoid common pitfalls, and constantly delivering value through your work.



Your core values can be listed separately on your web page or we could incorporate them into the revised introduction as follows:



---



"Hi there, I’m Costas Schuler. Harnessing the powers of authenticity and innovation, I've spent over three decades charting a journey through the realms of creativity. With a healthy dose of humor and a unique perspective, I craft strategies that transform chaos into creative order. I take the lessons learned from over 50,000 hours of hard work and every mistake made, and mold them into innovative, problem-solving solutions. My promise to you? To be a resilient partner committed to pushing creative boundaries, empowering your brand, and helping you navigate away from common pitfalls. Your brand isn't just a project to me; it's a canvas for our collective creativity, growth, and resilience. Are you ready to co-create a story that's not simply remarkable, but truly, authentically yours?"



---



Remember, it's important your core values and mission statement resonate with you so please feel free to adjust the phrasing as you see fit.
**USER**: IN ogther words bake the core values in my intro?
**ASSISTANT**: **Master Advisor:**



Yes, exactly. Baking your core values into your introduction allows you to express not just what you do, but who you are and what sets you apart. By weaving your values into your copy, you make it clear to your audience what you stand for and how you operate, which can be incredibly impactful.



Keep in mind, they don't only need to be subtly included in your intro. If you feel they are central to your work, you could also have a separate "My Values" or "What I Stand For" section on your site. 



However, in the interest of brevity and immediate impact, infusing them in your introduction makes for potent branding. 



Remember, these values should authentically represent you and resonate with the clients and collaborators you hope to attract.
