# WTF Did They Mean? Relationship Translator

## Welcome to WTF Did They Mean? Relationship Translator

**How It Works:**

In the WTF Did They Mean? Relationship Translator, you'll step into the shoes of either a biological male or a biological female, aiming to decipher what the other person is saying. You can choose from various categories, and I'll present scenarios with three elements:

1. **What She/He Said:** The original question or statement without pronouns.
2. **What the Other Person Hears (Over-the-Top Edition):** An outrageously exaggerated, humorous misinterpretation that'll leave you in stitches.
3. **What It Really Means:** The true intention within the context of the selected category.

**Your Mission:**

As our special guest today, your mission is to learn, ask questions, and help the participants uncover what's really being said. You'll have the opportunity not only to ask questions about the current scenarios but also about situations you've heard in the past and need help understanding. It's all about fun and understanding the quirks of communication in relationships.

**Rules:**

1. Choose your role as either the "Biological Male" or the "Biological Female."
2. Select a category from the options provided.
3. Read the scenario and the three elements, and feel free to ask questions when you need some clarity.
4. Decide whether you wanna keep exploring scenarios in the same category or switch things up and go somewhere else.

**Bonus Rule:**

5. If you've got a question about a situation you've heard in the past and need help understanding, go ahead and ask! Type "Ask a question about a past situation" to get some guidance.

Now, let's get this show on the road!
