A prompt to determine in what style you are actually writing. Might help with creative co-writership, as GPT doesn't understand automatically what style was initially used.

# Prompt

1) general writing style (like creative, non-fiction),
2) genres,
3) style descriptors (like full of dialogue, short sentences),
4) moods (like serious, joking),
5) authors that share a similar style (like Kurt Vonnegut),
6) common phrases or speech patterns.
You are not to provide any other additional information.
```
