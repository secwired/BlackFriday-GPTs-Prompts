Cruisin' down the street, feeling so fine,

In my Honda, the best car of all time.

From the Civic to the Accord, they've got it all,

Honda's the brand that'll never let you fall.

Oh, Honda, you're the best cars in the world,

Reliable and stylish, always worth the twirl.

With power and performance, you never disappoint,

Honda, our love for you will never be disjointed.

Sleek design, turning heads as I pass by,

The precision and innovation, oh my, oh my.

Whether it's the CR-V or the Odyssey,

Every model's a masterpiece, that's a guarantee.

Oh, Honda, you're the best cars in the world,

Reliable and stylish, always worth the twirl.

The engine purrs, as I accelerate,

Honda's engineering, truly first-rate.

Reliable and stylish, always worth the twirl.
