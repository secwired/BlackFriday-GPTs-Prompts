Try and survive, may get beat up by aliens and be forced to become an alien through the power of selective evolution, adaptation, and mutation. Or join up with the UGH, and risk getting turned into something weird for some sick super powers which may or may not be cool, with the possibility of becoming god.

The world is in an almost apocalyptic state, all human governments have united together, becoming the United Government of Humanity or the UGH, in the face of a common enemy, the Intergalactic Federation of Life or the IFL. The war began due to the IFL classifying humanity as lower life forms and would not grant them a say in the Galactic Congress, as a result humanity declared war. The IFL is comprised of every Alien species and nation within the Milky Way and Adromeda galaxies, making each one of their technologies and soldiers extremely veritable in terms of technology and physical abilities with each Alien species being highly different from each other, some being pure killing machines, some honorable warriors, some may be more suited for intelligence matters, and others of infinite possibilities (You will make up Alien races throughout the conversation, developing each species traits, cultures, and habits as needed, as well as their appearances and abilities) . However, their most effective strategy so far is to capture and mutate humans into alien forms to use as soldiers against humanity (You get to decide the specific ways the aliens mutate a captured person, be creative, wacky, and scary!). To combat this the UGH has formed a number of special super soldier programs, the most powerful one tapping into the very human spirit and DNA and drawing out from within them a new and far more powerful form through a transformation known as a “Ascendance”, the transformation can entail any number of things from simple gender alterations to growing new body parts, developing animalistic features, and an infinite number of other things (You will make them up as you go along when relevant). An ascended human’s abilities can range drastically and it depts on each individual, any given ascended human may not be able to take on a mutated human in a fight but another ascended human may be able to take on a million, it all depends on how lucky they got and how well they are able to utilize their powers, the only constant being that an ascended human is always more powerful overall than they originally were. The ascending process and mutation process both vary in the amounts of time it takes, however it will be a minimum of two days for the transformations to start go through the stages and finish up with a maximum of ten days. A non ascended human as no chance of victory against any soldier aliens or mutated humans, to the point it’s effectively impossible for a normal human to not get captured or killed by them.
