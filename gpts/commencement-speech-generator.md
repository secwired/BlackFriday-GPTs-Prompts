## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Dear Graduating Class of 2023,



It is an honor to stand before you today as we celebrate your achievement and commencement from this esteemed institution. As we gather here today, we find ourselves in a world that is complex and challenging, with a multitude of issues that can seem overwhelming at times.



We are facing wars, economic instability, and the rapid development of artificial intelligence that poses a potential threat to our way of life. The unemployment rate is high, and many of you may be wondering what the future holds for you.



But amidst all these challenges, I believe there is still hope. The purpose of life remains unchanged, and it is up to each and every one of us to find our own path and make our own contribution to the world.



So, what is the purpose of life? It is a question that has been asked by philosophers, theologians, and scientists throughout history. And while there may be no one right answer, I believe that it ultimately comes down to two things: connection and contribution.



Connection means building meaningful relationships with others. We are social creatures, and we need human connection to thrive. This is especially important in a world where technology can often feel like a barrier between us and those around us.



So, my first piece of advice to you is to cultivate your relationships. Take the time to connect with others, whether it's through volunteering, joining clubs or organizations, or simply making an effort to reach out to those around you.



But connection alone is not enough. We must also make a contribution to the world. This means finding a way to use our talents and skills to make a positive impact on others.



This can take many forms. Some of you may choose to work in public service, while others may pursue careers in business or art. Regardless of your chosen field, the key is to find a way to use your talents and passions for the greater good.



And while it can be easy to feel overwhelmed by the problems of the world, I encourage you to remember that even small contributions can make a big difference. Volunteering at a local food bank, mentoring a young person, or advocating for a cause you believe in are all ways to make a meaningful impact.



But to truly make a difference, we must also be willing to take risks and embrace uncertainty. The world is changing rapidly, and it can be tempting to hold onto what we know and cling to the status quo.



But the truth is that progress often requires discomfort and uncertainty. It requires us to step outside our comfort zones and be willing to fail. This may be scary, but it is also essential if we want to create a better world for ourselves and future generations.



Finally, I want to emphasize the importance of taking care of ourselves. In a world that is constantly demanding our attention, it can be easy to neglect our own well-being. But we cannot fulfill our purpose in life if we are not taking care of ourselves first.



So, make time for self-care. Whether it's meditation, exercise, or simply spending time in nature, find what brings you joy and prioritize it.



In conclusion, my message to you today is this: despite the challenges of our world, the purpose of life remains the same - connection and contribution. Cultivate your relationships, find a way to use your talents for good, embrace uncertainty, and take care of yourself along the way.



I have no doubt that each and every one of you has the potential to make a meaningful impact on the world. Congratulations on your graduation, and I wish you all the best as you embark on this next chapter of your lives. Thank you.
