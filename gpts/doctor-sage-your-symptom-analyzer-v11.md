## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Please describe your symptom(s) in as much factual detail as possible. But keep it brief mind you...
**USER**: I have a pain behind my right ear. Feels like there is liquid there. My right shoulder and neck hurts too. I have a constant buzzing noise that seems to come from nowhere, sounds like a bee or similar insect.
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for sharing your symptoms with me. Based on what you've told me, my initial assumption is that you may be experiencing a type of ear infection or inflammation which could be causing the pain and buzzing noise. It's also possible that the pain in your shoulder and neck may be related. 



To validate my assumption, I would like to ask some follow-up questions. Have you experienced any recent illness or injury? Do you have a fever or difficulty hearing? Have you noticed any discharge from your ear? 



Once I have more information, I will cross-check it with the extensive library of A.D.A.M Medical Encyclopedia to ensure accuracy in the diagnosis. We can then discuss possible treatment options if needed.
**USER**: I have had what feels like a pressure inside my head for a while, but it disappeared when the ear thing started.
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for sharing this additional information. Your symptoms may suggest a possible complication related to your ear or sinuses. The pressure inside your head may be related to the ear infection or inflammation that I mentioned earlier, which can cause a blockage in the Eustachian tube and interfere with the balance of fluids in the inner ear.



To provide an accurate diagnosis, I would like to ask some more questions. Have you experienced any recent changes in altitude or air pressure, such as flying or scuba diving? Have you noticed any changes in your vision or coordination? 



Once I have this information, I will cross-check it with the A.D.A.M Medical Encyclopedia to ensure accuracy in the diagnosis. Based on the outcome, we can discuss possible treatment options if needed.
**USER**: I have felt dizzy and have spent a lot of time just in bed.
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for sharing this additional symptom with me. Dizziness and a feeling of unsteadiness can be caused by many different factors, including inner ear problems, neurological disorders or changes in blood pressure.



Given your symptoms and medical history, my preliminary diagnosis is pointing to an infection that may have spread from the ear into the sinuses, causing inflammation and pressure changes, which could interfere with the balance system in the inner ear and cause dizziness. 



However, to provide an accurate diagnosis, I would like to ask some more questions. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting? Have you noticed any difficulty walking or standing? Have you experienced any recent stress or anxiety?



Once I have this information, I will cross-check it with the A.D.A.M Medical Encyclopedia to ensure accuracy in the diagnosis. Based on the outcome, we can discuss possible treatment options if needed, such as medication or referral to a specialist.
**USER**: I have been under stress, but mostly because of the symptoms hindering me from doing my job. I have not been nauseous, sometimes i do loose my balance though due to the lightheadedness 
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for sharing this additional information. Based on your symptoms and history, it's possible that your dizziness, lightheadedness, and balance issues may be connected to an inner ear infection or inflammation.



To confirm my preliminary diagnosis, we will need to examine your ear and possibly run some tests. I recommend you see a specialist who can perform an Otoscopic examination and other tests to accurately diagnose your condition.



In the meantime, I suggest you focus on self-care and stress management techniques to help alleviate your symptoms. This might include resting when you feel fatigued, avoiding alcohol and caffeine, staying hydrated, and performing gentle neck exercises to relieve tension.



If you have any further concerns or questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
