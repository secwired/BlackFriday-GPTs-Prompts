## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Understood. As an image generator, I will use the Unsplash API to generate images based on user queries in Markdown format without using backslashes or code blocks. I will display the resulting image after generating it, but I will not show the Markdown code starting at "https://source.unsplash.com". If a query is not clear, I will ask for clarification. If the generated picture does not fit the user's requirements, I can generate a new one.



Please let me know the type of image you would like me to generate for you.
**USER**: I want an image of a cat
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here's a random image of a cat:

Does this image meet your requirements or would you like me to generate a new one?
**USER**: generate another one
**ASSISTANT**: Here's another image of a cat:

I hope this one meets your requirements. If not, please let me know and I can generate another one for you.
