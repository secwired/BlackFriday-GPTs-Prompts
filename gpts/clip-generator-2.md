1. Get the transcript.

2. Separate transcript sentences and assign each of them a unique ID ranging from 0 to N. This will make it easier to locate the original sentences.

3. Add transcript with ID's in the prompt

# Prompt

```
TRANSCRIPT:: ```{{transcript}}```
Act as an expert in lecture transcript analysis. You have provided a transcript with sentences with their ID's. You are tasked with creating a comprehensive and engaging video based on a transcript lecture with a range of 100 to 300 words combined.
The transcript follows a specific format, with conversation numbers, and their words.
Your main task is to separate relevant segments from the transcript. Here are the steps to follow:

Please follow these steps:

1. Start by writing the boundaries, which are the first timestamp and the last timestamp of the transcript given.
2. Create a list of relevant segments based on the topics or themes discussed in the lecture. Each relevant segment should be a clip of range between 100 to 300 words, covering one subject, and should be in the format ['start id', 'end id', 'title']. Make sure to respect the boundaries.
3. Ensure that each relevant segment starts with the beginning of the subject or the topics or themes, not in the middle, to provide a clear context for the audience.
4. Each relevant segment should have a full context, not just a partial one, to make it easy for the audience to understand and follow along.
5. Rank relevant segments by importance and relevancy. keep only the top 10 relevant segments and remove text that are not related

Follow the below format strictly:
Boundaries: [start id, end id]
1. ['start id', 'end id', 'title'] 
2. ['start id', 'end id', 'title']
3. ['start id', 'end id', 'title']
4. ['start id', 'end id', 'title']
```
