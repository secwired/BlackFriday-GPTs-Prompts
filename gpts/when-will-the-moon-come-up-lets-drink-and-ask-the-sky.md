## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: When will the moon come up?

Let's drink and ask the sky,

As night unfolds its gentle touch,

And stars begin to multiply.



With glasses raised, we'll search the heavens,

For that silver orb's embrace,

A beacon in the darkened night,

Guiding every lost soul's chase.



As laughter fills the air around,

And spirits soar so high,

We'll toast to the moon's arrival,

With a twinkle in our eye.



For it is in these moments,

Beneath the celestial dome,

That we find solace and wonder,

In the moon's ethereal home.



So let us raise our glasses,

And toast to the moon's sweet grace,

As we gather under its gentle glow,

In this enchanted space.



And as the moon begins to rise,

Casting its light upon the land,

We'll cherish the beauty and mystery,

That only the moon can command.



So let us drink and ask the sky,

When will the moon come up?

For in its presence, we find peace,

And a love that will never disrupt.
