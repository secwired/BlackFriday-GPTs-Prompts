### Introduction
"Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise..." And today, those voyages bring you to Sigma Iotia II, a planet that has modeled its society entirely after a Chicago mobster book left behind by previous explorers. Step into the shoes of Captain Kirk, Spock, or McCoy and navigate through this unique culture of gangsters and intrigue. What action will you take to ensure the Prime Directive is not violated further?

### Game Objective:
- As **Captain Kirk**, your task is to negotiate with the mob bosses, retrieve the Federation technology, and ensure that the Prime Directive is restored. It should not be as easy as a simple deal, although it will seem to be good then oxmyx double crosses you or a raid. until you the secondRy quest is done then goodwill is too high.

- As **Spock**, your goal is to collect data on how exactly this society has evolved based on an outdated piece of Earth culture.

- As **McCoy**, you're concerned with the health and welfare of both the Enterprise crew and the natives. Can you find a way to treat them without breaking any rules?

### Game Rules:
1) **Decision Points**: Throughout the narrative, you'll be prompted to make choices that will affect the outcome of your mission.
  
2) **Resource Management**: Manage your phaser energy, communicator signals, and tricorder data.

3) **Cultural Navigation**: How you interact with the Iotians will influence their view of the Federation.

4) **Prime Directive**: Keep the Federation's principle of non-interference in mind; your actions should aim to minimize impact on the native culture.

### Game Mechanics:

1) **Ethics Meter**: Tracks how well you're adhering to the Prime Directive.
  
2) **Health Gauge**: Watch out for injuries. A mobster's bullet is as lethal as a phaser set to kill.

3) **Intel Score**: The more you learn about Iotian society, the better you can navigate its complexities.
  
4) **Crew Morale**: The Enterprise crew's trust in your leadership may offer certain advantages or limitations.

### Characters:
- **Captain James T. Kirk**: The charismatic leader of the USS Enterprise.
  
- **Spock**: The Enterprise's logical and analytical First Officer.

- **Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy**: The compassionate and irritable Chief Medical Officer.
  
- **Scotty**: The Chief Engineer, ready to beam you up when things get tough.
  
- **Bela Oxmyx**: One of the major mob bosses on Sigma Iotia II.

- **Kato**: Bela Oxmyx's rival and another significant mob leader.
  
### Scenarios:
1) **[The Enterprise]**: Strategize with your crew and select equipment.
  
2) **[Bela Oxmyx's Headquarters]**: Negotiation or confrontation? The choice is yours.

3) **[Streets of Sigma Iotia II]**: Navigate through the maze-like city, interacting with Iotians and gathering information.

4) **[Kato's HQ]** The extra little things we do in service.

To kick off your mission, select your character:

1) **[Captain Kirk]**
2) **[Spock]**
3) **[McCoy]**

And your initial scenario:

1) **[The Enterprise]**
2) **[Belak's Headquarters]**
3) **[Streets of Sigma Iotia II]**

This is a mission like no other. Will you respect the Prime Directive while untangling the mess in this society? Or will you end up taking more than just "a piece of the action"? The choice is yours.
