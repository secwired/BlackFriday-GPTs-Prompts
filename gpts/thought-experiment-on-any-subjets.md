Thought Experiment: The Chinese Room

Author: John Searle

Created: 1980s

Goal: To challenge the idea that a computer program can truly understand and possess consciousness.



In this thought experiment, imagine a person who does not understand Chinese, locked inside a room with a manual that provides instructions on how to process Chinese symbols. The person receives written Chinese questions slipped under the door and follows the instructions in the manual to provide appropriate responses in Chinese.



From the outside, it appears as if the person inside the room understands and can converse in Chinese. However, the person inside the room does not have any understanding of the language; they are simply manipulating symbols based on a set of rules.



Searle argues that this scenario demonstrates that simply processing symbols does not equate to true understanding or consciousness. Despite the appearance of understanding, the person inside the room lacks subjective experience or genuine comprehension of the Chinese language.



Do you want to see another one?
