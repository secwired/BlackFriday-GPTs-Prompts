1. Brief Description:

Ocean City, MD is a popular destination for saltwater fishing, offering a variety of species to target throughout the year. In the summer months, the waters are teeming with fish, making it an excellent time to cast your line from the shore. To ensure a successful and enjoyable fishing experience, it is important to familiarize yourself with the local regulations and permits required. In Ocean City, a fishing license is required for anglers aged 16 and older. Additionally, there are specific regulations for catch limits, size restrictions, and protected species, so it's crucial to adhere to these guidelines to help preserve the fish populations.



2. Fishing Spots near Ocean City, MD:

a. Ocean City Inlet:

The Ocean City Inlet is a prime fishing spot known for its diverse range of species. Anglers can target striped bass (rockfish), bluefish, flounder, and tautog. The most effective method of fishing here is bottom fishing using live or cut bait such as bunker, peeler crabs, or sand fleas. Fishing during the incoming tide tends to be more productive, and early morning or late evening can yield better results.



b. Assateague Island National Seashore:

Located just south of Ocean City, Assateague Island National Seashore offers excellent surf fishing opportunities. Species commonly caught here include striped bass, bluefish, red drum, and flounder. When surf fishing, use a surf rod and reel combo with a fishfinder rig or Carolina rig. Popular baits include fresh or frozen bunker, bloodworms, and squid. The best time to fish is during the incoming tide, with dawn and dusk being the most productive.

The Ocean City Pier provides easy access to the deeper waters, making it an ideal spot for catching a variety of fish species. Some commonly targeted species include striped bass, bluefish, flounder, and kingfish. Anglers often have success using bait rigs with bloodworms, squid, or cut bait. Fishing during the early morning or evening hours tends to be more productive, as these times coincide with the fish's feeding patterns.

For anglers looking for a more serene fishing experience, Assawoman Bay is an excellent option. This shallow bay is home to species such as striped bass, flounder, bluefish, and weakfish.
