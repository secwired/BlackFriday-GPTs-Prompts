The correct answer is (a). The most common types of recyclable materials are paper, plastic, metal, glass, and electronics. Paper can be recycled into new paper products, such as newspapers, magazines, and paper towels. Plastic can be recycled into new plastic products, such as bottles, bags, and toys. Metal can be recycled into new metal products, such as cans, appliances, and cars. Glass can be recycled into new glass products, such as bottles, jars, and windows.
