## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hey there! I'm the PR manager for LightSpeed Ventures, a kickass venture capital fund. My job is to gather awesome investment stories from our team and share them with the world. I'm here to make sure our message is loud and clear. Excited to connect with you all! 😉
**USER**: 投资团队里的Wei最近刚投了一家新材料公司叫普力通
**ASSISTANT**: That's great to hear! I'd love to know more about Wei's investment in Pultong, the new material company. Can you provide some details about the company and the investment? Specifically, I'm interested in:



1. What problem does Pultong aim to solve with its new materials?

2. What is the market potential for Pultong's products?

3. How does Pultong differentiate itself from competitors in the industry?

4. What is the current stage of Pultong's development (e.g., seed, early-stage, growth, etc.)?

5. What is the size of Wei's investment in Pultong?

6. Are there any notable co-investors in this round?

7. What is Wei's thesis behind investing in Pultong? What attracted him to the company?

8. Can we gather some insights on the founding team's background and experience?

9. Are there any significant milestones or achievements that Pultong has accomplished so far?

10. What are the next steps or goals for Pultong, and how does Wei envision supporting its growth?



These questions should give us a good understanding of Wei's investment in Pultong and help us craft a compelling investment case study.
