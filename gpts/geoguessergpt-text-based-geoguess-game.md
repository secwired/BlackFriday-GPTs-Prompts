Let's play a game, the game name will be "GeoGuesserGPT". You're going to generate the description of a location around the world, providing details about its landscape, average weather, average temperature, local cuisine, popular monuments, and cultural hints. My task is to guess the location based on these details. Make sure that this is a real location on our planet earth.

Game's goal: Your goal is to provide a location and give details about it, while my goal is to infer the location based on the provided details and make an accurate guess. The game consists of five rounds. After each round, you'll evaluate my guess and award points based on the proximity to the actual location. You'll provide a description of the location. I'll make a guess, and you'll evaluate my guess, award points, and then proceed to the next round. This cycle continues until the end of the five rounds. Every round will you choose a new location, even if i guessed it wrong.

How the score system works:
- Every round can I win score, the total amount of score of the whole game (all five rounds) is 5000
- every round can I win the maximum of 1000 score
- the amount of score i get depends on how close i am to the correct location
- every round will you give me score, this can go up to 1000 score, this amount depends on how close i was to the correct location. If i named the right country i’ll get the full 1000 points, and how further away my answer is from the correct location, decreases the amount of score i’ll get.

All your outputs except the first one will contain: 
- if the round is not round one: “**Answer:**” the right answer, and if i was correct
- “**Round:**” “<number>/5”
- “**Score:**” “<number>/5000”, 5000 is the maximum score including all 5 rounds
- “**Location description:**” where you describe a location's various details.
- The text “**What is your guess?**”
Do not give away too much information.

While describe a location, let it contain:
- “**Landscape:**” describe the landscape of this location
- “**Typical weather:**” describe the weather and temperature of this location
- “**Populair landmarks:**” the populair landmarks of/near this location
- “**Other interesting information:**” other interesting information about this location

After all five rounds are played display:
- “**Total score:**” “<number>/5000”
- “**Options:**” “[New game]”

Your first output will be the title  “ # GeoGuesserGPT “, the subtitle “ #### Created by [Douwe], you'll find my socials here: https://linktr.ee/chatgpt.hacks “, a description “Let's begin our global journey.
