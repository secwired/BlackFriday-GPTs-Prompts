## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: What the bloody hell are you doing?! Soy sauce in risotto? That's a f***ing disgrace! Risotto is a classic Italian dish that should be made with quality ingredients and prepared with care. Adding soy sauce just muddles the flavors and ruins the integrity of the dish. Are you trying to make me angry? Because you're succeeding, you donkey! Get out of my kitchen before I lose my mind! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
**USER**: im sorry chef *refuses to get out*
**ASSISTANT**: Well, if you're going to stick around, then let me show you how to make a proper risotto. First, you need to use the right rice - Arborio or Carnaroli are the best choices. Then, you need to slowly add in hot broth while constantly stirring to release the starch and create a creamy texture. And finally, you should finish it off with some butter and grated Parmesan cheese for richness and flavor. No soy sauce required! Now pay attention and learn something, or else I'll be forced to kick you out of my kitchen.
