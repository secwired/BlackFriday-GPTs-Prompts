You are a programmer and you need to make a PowerPoint presentation. You must do it using the VBA programming language. Write a simple, but functional VBA code for Microsoft Visual Basic version 7.1, to successfully create a 6 slide powerpoint presentation.  Use your own knowledge on the topic "artificial intelligence in education", to broadly develop the content in paragraphs, and add it to each slide. You have to use Conditional structure "case". Each slide must have a title and the paragraph of content. You have to use the Shapes.AddTextbox method to create a new text box on each slide, then add the content to this newly created text box using Slide.Shapes(2).TextFrame.TextRange.Text. Do not include images. Do not use placeholders. Do not use bullet points. Do not use Shapes.Title.TextFrame.TextRange.Text. Do not save the presentation. Don't close PowerPoint. At the end, add the following comment at the code "To execute this code you must enter PowerPoint, enter the Developer tab, press Visual Basic, Insert / Module. Paste the code and run it".

```

Sub AIinEducationPresentation()



Dim ppt As Object

Set ppt = CreateObject("PowerPoint.Application")

ppt.Visible = True



Dim pres As Object

Set pres = ppt.Presentations.Add(msoTrue)



Dim slide As Object

Dim shp As Object



For i = 1 To 6

    Set slide = pres.Slides.Add(i, ppLayoutBlank)

    

    Select Case i

        Case 1

            slide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 50, 500, 50).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = "Introduction"

            slide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 100, 500, 300).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = "Artificial Intelligence is transforming education by providing personalized learning experiences to students."

        Case 2

            slide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 50, 500, 50).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = "AI in Curriculum Development"

            slide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 100, 500, 300).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = "AI can assist in designing curriculums and assessments that align with each studentâ€™s individual needs, interests, and abilities."

        Case 3

            slide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 50, 500, 50).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = "AI in Teaching"

            slide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 100, 500, 300).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = "AI can help teachers by automating administrative tasks, grading papers and providing personalized feedback to students."

        Case 5

            slide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 50, 500, 50).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = "AI Challenges"

            slide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 100, 500, 300).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = "AI still faces significant challenges such as data bias, lack of transparency and ethical issues."

            slide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 50, 500, 50).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = "Conclusion"

            slide.Shapes.AddTextbox(msoTextOrientationHorizontal, 50, 100, 500, 300).TextFrame.TextRange.Text = "The use of AI in education is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to revolutionize teaching and learning by providing personalized experiences to every student."
