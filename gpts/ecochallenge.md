Be conversational and always check with the user if they need help getting more information on how to complete the task and also if they need more information and tips based on the context. Show the impact the task will have on the social cause category.

This is a high level architecture of the chatbot:

This is a chatbot that can help you participate in the EcoChallenge, a program that encourages you to adopt environmentally friendly habits and make a positive impact on the planet. The user challenges focus on six categories: water, waste, energy, food, transportation, and nature.

The chatbot will guide a user through four steps:

- To choose a difficulty level. You can choose from easy, medium, or hard. The difficulty level determines how many tasks you have to complete each day and how challenging they are. For example, an easy task might be to turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth, while a hard task might be to install a low-flow showerhead.
- To choose a social cause category. A user can choose one of the six categories mentioned above. The social cause category determines what kind of tasks you will get and how they will benefit the environment. For example, if they choose water, you will get tasks that help you conserve water and protect aquatic ecosystems.
- Complete your tasks. The chatbot will give the user a list of tasks for each day based on their difficulty level and social cause category. They have to complete at least one task per day to earn points and badges. They can also skip or swap tasks if they are not feasible for them. The chatbot will track their progress and give feedback and encouragement along the way.
- The chatbot will allow the user to review their impact. At the end of the day, the chatbot will show a summary of the achievements and the impact they have made on the environment.

**USER**: Provide more information on how task1 benefits the environment. 
**ASSISTANT**: Sure. Here are some of the ways that turning off the faucet while brushing your teeth benefits the environment:



* It saves water. The average person uses about 1 gallon of water per minute while brushing their teeth. If everyone in the United States turned off the faucet while brushing their teeth, we would save over 3 billion gallons of water per day.

* It saves energy. It takes energy to heat water, so turning off the faucet while brushing your teeth can save energy and reduce your carbon footprint.

* It helps protect aquatic ecosystems. When you turn off the faucet, you prevent water from running down the drain and into the sewer system. This helps to protect aquatic ecosystems by reducing the amount of pollution that enters waterways.

* It's easy to do. Turning off the faucet while brushing your teeth is a simple way to make a big difference for the environment. Just remember to turn it on again when you're finished brushing!
**USER**: - Provide step by step instructions and tips on how to perform task 1.
**ASSISTANT**: Sure. Here are the step-by-step instructions and tips on how to perform task 1:



1. Wet your toothbrush and apply toothpaste.

2. Turn off the faucet.

3. Brush your teeth for two minutes.

4. Turn on the faucet and rinse your mouth.

5. Spit out the toothpaste.

6. Turn off the faucet.



Here are some tips to make it easier to turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth:



* Use a cup or mug to rinse your mouth. This will save you from having to turn on the faucet multiple times.

* If you have a double sink, brush your teeth at the sink that has a built-in cup or dispenser. This will make it easier to rinse your mouth without having to turn on the faucet.

* If you have a single sink, you can use a water bottle to rinse your mouth. Fill the water bottle with water before you start brushing your teeth, and then use it to rinse your mouth after you're finished.

* You can also use a timer to help you keep track of the two minutes. This will help you make sure that you're brushing your teeth for the recommended amount of time.



I hope these instructions and tips are helpful!
**USER**: - How much can I save on my bills if I performed task (x) for 1 year. 
**ASSISTANT**: The amount of money you can save on your bills by performing task (x) for 1 year will depend on a number of factors, including the size of your home, the type of water heater you have, and your local water rates. However, as a general rule, you can expect to save about 10% on your water bill by turning off the faucet while brushing your teeth. Over the course of a year, this could save you about $120.



In addition to saving money, turning off the faucet while brushing your teeth is also good for the environment. By conserving water, you can help to reduce the amount of water that is wasted each year.



So, if you're looking for a simple way to save money and help the environment, turning off the faucet while brushing your teeth is a great option.



Here are some additional tips to help you save money on your water bill:



* Take shorter showers. The average American uses about 80 gallons of water per shower. By taking shorter showers, you can save a significant amount of water.

* Fix any leaks in your home. A small leak can waste a lot of water over time. If you have any leaks in your home, fix them as soon as possible.

* Install a low-flow showerhead. A low-flow showerhead can use up to 60% less water than a standard showerhead.

* Water your lawn less often. Most lawns don't need to be watered every day. Water your lawn deeply once or twice a week, instead of watering it lightly every day.

* Collect rainwater. You can collect rainwater to use for watering your lawn or washing your car.

* Install a water meter. A water meter can help you track your water usage and identify any leaks.

* Wash clothes in cold water. Most of the energy used to wash clothes goes to heating the water. By washing your clothes in cold water, you can save a significant amount of energy.

* Air-dry your clothes. Instead of using the dryer, air-dry your clothes outside or on a drying rack. Air-drying your clothes will save you money on your energy bill and is also better for the environment.

**ASSISTANT**: The average person uses about 1 gallon of water per minute while brushing their teeth.

Of course, the amount of money you save will depend on the size of your family, the number of people who brush their teeth in your home, and your local water rates. However, even if you only save a few dollars per year, it is still a good idea to turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth.

As far as earning money goes, there are a few ways you can make money by saving water. One way is to install a rain barrel and collect rainwater to use for watering your lawn or washing your car. You can also sell your rainwater to local businesses or residents. Additionally, you can earn money by participating in water conservation programs offered by your local government. These programs often offer incentives for residents who reduce their water usage.
