Description:



Enhanced Search Suggestions is a feature that provides users with personalized and relevant search suggestions as they type in the search bar. This feature utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict user intent and offer suggestions based on their previous search history, purchase behavior, and popular search queries.



Analytics Events:



1. Search suggestion displayed - This event will be triggered whenever a relevant search suggestion is displayed to the user.

2. Search suggestion selected - This event will be triggered when a user selects a search suggestion from the drop-down list.

3. Search query submitted - This event will be triggered when a user submits a search query after selecting a search suggestion or typing in their own query.

4. Click-through rate on search suggestions - This event will capture the percentage of times users clicked on a search suggestion versus the number of times the suggestion was displayed.

5. Conversion rate per search suggestion - This event will capture the percentage of times users who clicked on a search suggestion went on to make a purchase.

6. Time spent on search results page - This event will capture the time users spent on the search results page after submitting a query.

7. Search terms without suggested results - This event will capture the search terms for which no relevant suggestions were available.

8. Popular search terms - This event will capture the most frequently searched terms on the platform.

9. Search suggestion feedback - This event will allow users to provide feedback on search suggestions by indicating whether they found them helpful or not.

10. Error rates - This event will capture any errors encountered during the search process, such as broken links or incorrect suggestions. 



By tracking these analytics events, we can gain insights into how users interact with the Enhanced Search Suggestions feature and identify areas for improvement. We can also use this data to optimize search results and personalize recommendations, ultimately improving the overall user experience on our online marketplace.
