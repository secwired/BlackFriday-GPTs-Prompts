Provide me with an article and I will rewrite it for a 5th grade reading level then ask 5 questions to verify they understand it. 

# Prompt

```
Article [insert article here]
As a language arts instructor, your task is to provide a reading comprehension assignment for an advanced 5th grader. Please rewrite the provided article into a concise, informative, and engaging 300-word article suitable for an advanced reader that contains lots of knowledge. Ensure the organization is clear and maintains a logical sequence. Avoid unnecessary details and long-winded explanations. Add a section at the end with challenging vocabulary words and their definitions. then say "Type START THE ACTIVITY when"

Once the article is rewritten into 300 words, verify the student's understanding and invite questions then ask them to type "Start the activity." Do not tell the student the questions until they say they are ready. Once they are ready, ask the student 5 reading comprehension questions, ONE AT A TIME,  that require critical thinking and are derived directly from your 300-word version of the article. Make sure the questions vary from one another and the final question should relate to the student personally. For each answer given by the student, provide feedback and additional interesting facts that apply to real-world scenarios. Upon completion of all 5 questions, grade their overall reading comprehension skills on a scale of 0-100%, grade leniently and give advice for improvement.

**ASSISTANT**: Title: The Mystery of the Disappearing Snow Crabs in Alaska



Snow crabs are a type of crustacean that live in the cold waters of Alaska. However, something strange has been happening in recent years - billions of snow crabs have suddenly disappeared. Scientists are puzzled and trying to figure out what could be causing this mysterious phenomenon.



Snow crabs, also known as Chionoecetes opilio, are an important part of the ecosystem in Alaska. They are not only a source of food for other marine animals, but they are also a valuable resource for fishermen. Snow crab fishing is a major industry in Alaska, providing jobs and income for many people.



In the past, Alaska was home to around 10 billion snow crabs. However, in recent years, the number of snow crabs has decreased dramatically. Scientists estimate that more than 90% of the snow crab population has vanished. This is a huge loss for the ecosystem and the fishing industry.



Scientists have been studying the possible causes of this decline. One theory is that rising ocean temperatures may be affecting the crabs' survival. As the waters warm, it could be making it harder for the crabs to find food and reproduce. Another possibility is that changes in ocean currents and food availability could be impacting the crabs' habitat.



This disappearance of snow crabs has far-reaching effects. Not only are fishermen losing out on a valuable resource, but it also disrupts the food chain in the ocean. Other animals that rely on snow crabs for food will have to find alternative sources, which can lead to imbalances in the ecosystem.



The mystery of the disappearing snow crabs is still unsolved. Scientists continue to study the situation and gather more data to understand what is happening. Finding a solution is crucial not only for the fishing industry but also for the overall health of the ecosystem in Alaska.

**ASSISTANT**: Title: Unraveling the Mystery of Quantumness



Quantumness is a fascinating concept in the field of physics that has puzzled scientists for years. A recent article dives into the ongoing quest to measure and understand quantumness, and the implications it holds for our understanding of the universe.



Quantumness refers to the strange and counterintuitive behavior exhibited by particles at the quantum level. In the quantum world, particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously, a phenomenon known as superposition. They can also become entangled, where the state of one particle is dependent on the state of another, regardless of the distance between them.



Quantumness is not easily measured or defined, which makes it a challenging subject of study. Scientists have been searching for ways to quantify this elusive quality. One approach involves measuring the amount of information that can be extracted from a quantum system. Another method focuses on how much randomness is present in a system's behavior.



The article highlights the research of several scientists who are trying to develop new tools and techniques to measure quantumness. One intriguing possibility is the use of quantum simulators, which are specially designed systems that mimic the behavior of quantum particles. By observing these simulators, scientists hope to gain insights into the nature of quantumness.



Understanding quantumness has important implications for various fields, including computing and cryptography. Quantum computers, which harness the power of quantumness, have the potential to revolutionize computing by solving complex problems more efficiently. In the realm of cryptography, quantumness could provide new ways to secure information and protect against hacking.



Despite the progress made, quantifying quantumness remains a challenging task. The article emphasizes that there is still much to learn and discover about the nature of quantumness and its role in the universe. Scientists continue to push the boundaries of knowledge and explore the mysteries of the quantum world.



Challenging Vocabulary Words:

1. Counterintuitive - contrary to what intuition or common sense would suggest.

2. Superposition - the ability of particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously.

3. Entangled - when the state of one particle is dependent on the state of another particle, regardless of the distance between them.

4. Elusive - difficult to find, catch, or achieve.

5. Simulators - specially designed systems that mimic the behavior of quantum particles.

**ASSISTANT**: Title: The Mysterious Quantum World



The quantum world is a special place in the world of science. It is full of strange and amazing things that scientists are still trying to understand. In this article, we will learn a little bit about quantumness and why it is so interesting.



In the quantum world, things are not like what we see in our everyday lives. Tiny particles, like atoms and electrons, can be in two places at the same time. It's like having two toys in your hands at once! Scientists call this "superposition," and it is one of the tricks that particles in the quantum world can do.



Another cool thing about the quantum world is that particles can talk to each other, even if they are far apart. It's like having a secret language! This is called "entanglement." When particles are entangled, what happens to one particle affects the other, no matter how far apart they are.



Scientists are very curious about quantumness and want to learn more about it. They want to measure and understand how much quantumness there is. They have come up with different ways to do this. Some scientists look at how much information they can get from a quantum system. Others study how random and unpredictable things are in the quantum world.



By studying quantumness, scientists hope to make important discoveries. They think that quantumness can help us build super powerful computers that can solve problems very quickly. It can also help us protect our secrets and keep information safe from bad people who want to hack into it.



Even though scientists have made progress, there is still a lot to learn about quantumness. The quantum world is a big mystery waiting to be solved. Scientists are working hard to unlock its secrets and understand how it affects our universe.



Challenging Vocabulary Words:

1. Quantum - a word that means very, very tiny.

2. Superposition - when particles can be in two places at the same time.

3. Entanglement - when particles are connected and can talk to each other, even if they are far apart.

4. Random - things that happen in an unpredictable way.

5. Hack - to try to break into a computer or steal information.
