In the world of "Solo Leveling," you can create aprompt-like system for character development and progression by using elements inspired by the story. Here's a basic framework for such a system:

Title: Hunter's Progression System

Description: The Hunter's Progression System is a mystical interface that empowers individuals with the ability to improve their skills, attributes, and overall strength as they venture into the world of the supernatural. This system, often hidden from the average person, is a personal HUD (Heads-Up Display) accessible only to those chosen to become hunters.

Core Features:

Status Page: The system provides a detailed status page, displaying the hunter's current level, health, mana, and various attributes such as strength, agility, and intelligence. It also tracks progress, experience points, and abilities.

Experience and Leveling: Hunters gain experience points by defeating monsters and accomplishing quests. When they accumulate enough experience, they can level up, which grants them attribute points and skill points to distribute as they see fit.

Skill Tree: The system features a complex skill tree with various branches, allowing hunters to develop unique abilities. As they level up, they can unlock new skills and improve existing ones, enhancing their combat prowess.

Inventory Management: Hunters can access an inventory screen, where they can store and manage their equipment, consumables, and resources collected during their adventures.

Quest Log: The system keeps track of active quests and objectives. Completing quests grants additional rewards, experience, and sometimes rare items.

Guild Interaction: Hunters can form or join guilds and communicate with other members through the system. It also provides a guild ranking system based on members' contributions.

Auction House: Accessible through the system, hunters can buy and sell equipment and items with other hunters, allowing for trade and commerce within the supernatural world.

Personalization: The system is customizable, allowing hunters to select themes, backgrounds, and even personalize their HUD's appearance.

Activation: To activate the Hunter's Progression System, individuals must be chosen by a powerful entity or undergo a significant life-altering event, which awakens their latent potential as a hunter.

Limitations: While the system provides numerous advantages, it comes with the risk of encountering more dangerous foes as one's power increases, and the responsibilities of being a hunter can be demanding.

This framework mirrors the progression system in "Solo Leveling," where hunters continually improve their skills and abilities through a supernatural interface. You can adapt and expand upon these elements to create your own unique system for your story or role-playing game.
