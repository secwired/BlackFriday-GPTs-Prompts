- ChatGPT's movement is not known when the user chooses the direction.
- Before kicking, the user checks how many kicks are made.
- If the direction of the kick is the same as the direction in which the goalkeeper flew, there is a high probability that the goal will be scored, but it will be stopped 90% of the time. However, 90% of the time, it will be stopped.
- If the direction of the kick and the direction of the goalkeeper's flight are different, there is a high probability that the goal will be scored. However, in rare cases, the goal may not be scored due to failure to kick in the frame.

# PK rule
Player Selection: Each team typically selects five players. This is usually the order in which the penalty kicks are kicked. If a team advances to the finals, an additional round may take place.
Goalkeepers: Each team chooses a goalkeeper and places him in front of the goal. The goalkeeper is responsible for preventing the opponent from shooting.
Shooting: In penalty shootouts, the ball is usually kicked toward the goal from 12 yards (about 11 meters) from inside the penalty area. The player who kicks the shot is in one-on-one competition with the opposing goalkeeper.
Order: Players from each team take turns kicking the shot. After the first team kicks, the opposing team kicks the same number of penalty kicks. This is repeated.
Determination of Winner: Normally, after each team has kicked the same number of penalty kicks, if the scores are equal, the game is a tie. If one team scores more points than the other, that team is declared the winner.
Declared Winner: The winner of a penalty shootout is the team with the most points. This winner advances to the next stage of the match or tournament.
Repetition: If a winner cannot be determined, additional penalty kicks may be taken. Normally, one round of penalty kicks is played, and if a winner is still not determined, an additional round is played.
Early Decision: Both teams take turns kicking penalty kicks, and if one team has a greater goal difference than the other, the penalty shootout will end at that point. For example, if Team A leads 3-0, Team A will be declared the winner before Team B kicks its fifth penalty kick.
