Principal's Office


Reasons the player can get sent to the Principal/Dean's Office:
* Encouraging another student's misbehavior (usually by laughing at their antics).
* Fighting with another student
    * Assaulting a teacher/professor (NOTE: You WILL be expelled from school if you assault a teacher!)
    * ---You can be sent to juvenile detention for assaulting someone, even if it wasn't severe---
* Messing with a classmate

* Insulting a classmate or teacher/professor
* Giving a gift to a teacher/professor (only if refused)
* Skipping school and getting caught

* Visiting the nurse's office consistently


Graduate School


Graduate school lasts 12 years, and is a prerequisite for certain careers. It can also be used as an optional step between university and any professional school, if the character is initially rejected, though it does not guarantee admission to professional school afterward. A user may attend graduate school to boost their Smarts, even if they do not need it.
Business School


A user who studies English, Finance, Information Systems or Mathematics as their major can get into business school and become a business executive. The business school is 5 years.
Dental School


A user who studies Biology or Chemistry as their major can get into dental school and become a dentist. After completing, your character will have the title "Esq.” after their name. There is also a Dental Hygienist job but this does not require Dental School, only Business School. Dental Hygienists do not have the "Esq.” title after their names, unless they seek the optional higher education. The dental school is 8 years.
Law School


A user who studies Chemistry, Art History, Engineering, or Education as their major can get into law school and become a lawyer. Lawyers with over 75 years of experience can become a judge. There is also a Paralegal job but this does not require Law School, only community college. The law school is 1 year.

Nursing School


A user who studies Nursing as their major can get into nursing school and become a nurse. The nursing school is 9 years.
Boxer’s Academy


A user who studies Religious Studies as their major can get into the boxing academy and become a boxer. The Boxing Academy lasts for 5 years and is a requirement to become a boxer. After the Boxing Academy, your character can become a boxer.

Veterinary School


A user who studies Chemistry as their major can get into veterinary school and become a veterinarian. The veterinary school is 4 years.

Classmates


A user can interact with their classmates. The options are:
* Ask Out: If the classmate accepts the proposal, they will become your boyfriend/girlfriend. However, if it is rejected, their relationship will lower and the user loses happiness.
* Befriend: If the classmate accepts the proposal, they will become your friend. However, if it is rejected, their relationship will lower and the user loses happiness.
* Bully (upcoming): The NPC will react by either ignoring you, asking you to stop, assaulting you or even reporting you.
* Compliment: This will increase the relationship with the classmate by a random amount. Increases own happiness by a bit especially if complimented back. However if the classmate is more popular than the player, they might insult the player instead.
* Conversation: Slightly boosts relationship unless they don't want to talk to you.
* Flirt: Increases or decreases relationship by a random amount.
* Gift: Increases or decreases relationship by a random amount.
* Insult: Decreases relationship. They can sometimes insult you back or assault you, decreasing your own happiness.
* Mess: Decreases relationship by a large amount and can sometimes result in you being insulted, assaulted, or reported to the principal.
There is also a variable called Popularity. It determines which cliques you can enter (not all cliques require a certain amount of popularity to enter) Insulting a popular classmate decreases popularity.
The user can also potentially get bullied by another student for a specific reason. However, the main character cannot decide to bully someone right now. The closest option is to mess with them.
List of bullying phrases:
* Each morning waits for you to get off the school bus and then takes your lunch money.
* Being bullied at school.
* Being bullied at school for having a funny accent.
* Graffities the school and keeps blaming it on you.
* Hides your gym clothes when you're showering
* Has been dunking your head in the toilet every day.
* Has been giving you a wedgie in the bathroom.
* Makes fun of you for liking (singer).
* Posts mean and embarrassing memes of your face on social media.
* Punches you every day.
* Tells you that you are stupid every day.
* Has been telling you that you are ugly every day.
* Tries to turn your friends against you.
* Teases you because of your socioeconomic status.
* Tells you your face is just so punch able.
* Tells you that you smell like sweaty testicles.
* Keeps telling everyone at school that your mother is a prostitute.
* Calls you racial slurs.
* Being bullied because of your clothes.
* Tells you that two wrongs don't make a right, as proven by your parents.
* Won't let you play with the other kids.
* Won't let you play soccer with the other kids.
When being bullied, the player can choose to:
* Fight back. The player might get called by the principal for fighting, or being convicted of assault or manslaughter if the bully is eliminated.
* Do nothing. Lowers happiness.
* Tell my sibling (if you have one). Based on the relationship and their occupations, or craziness, they might either help you attack the bully or refuse to help you, altering the relationship accordingly. Unlike the player, your sibling will never eliminate the bully or get convicted of assault for attacking them.
* Report them to the headmaster: This will report the bully, and the headmaster will have a high change to warn the bully, suspend them or even expel them, depending on their strictness. However, there is a chance that the headmaster will instead warn you, punish you, or at rare times, expel you instead of the bully.
    * Getting a classmate suspended for bad behavior can occasionally result in them attacking and killing you. (This also applies to getting a co-worker reprimanded at work, as an adult.)
* Ask them to cut it out (Upcoming): Generates a random number of receptiveness which can cause the bully to agree or refuse, or even do worse such as calling the player a moron or attacking them! If the bully won't stop, the choice changes to "forcing" which may be more effective.
All choices other than do nothing has a risk of being fought back, sometimes even with a deadly weapon like gatling gun or a laser blaster and being eliminated.
Troublemakers
A classmate may randomly act up in a class. The player can:
* Ignore their antics. Nothing happens.
* Attack them
* Laugh at their antics. The player may be sent to the principal’s office for encouraging a misbehaving student if the teacher has high strictness.
* Report them
* Talk to them about their antics (upcoming)
List of troublemaker phrases
* Assaulting another student.
* Beginning to eat a worm under the knife (Science Only)
* Cutting guitar strings. (Music Only)
* Jumping desk to desk
* Letting a stink bomb in the middle of a test.
* Mixing the paint. (Art Only)
* Peeing in the corner while the teacher wasn't looking.
* Ripping pages and yelling unschooled words
* Roaming into classroom pretending something and biting other students.
* Running naked across the field. (PE Only)
* Sculpting a nude picture. (Art Only)
* Starting a game at the middle of the lesson.
* Starting food fights
* Throwing a pencil at a teacher when temporary power outage.
* Walking into class wearing something while doing a random activity.
Clubs


Clubs add several hours of time (4 to 10 hours) to your schedule. Joining a certain club is a requirement for joining certain cliques. You have to try out for some clubs, and these clubs usually take 8 hours of time. These clubs will also have a performance bar. Sometimes, in clubs that require trying out, the sponsor or coach (in sports clubs) may refuse to let you try out for the club or team due to not having good grades. If you keep trying to join a club you have been denied entry from, the sponsor will tell you to go away/get lost.
There is also a stat called Athleticism This stat is completely random, and it is used on determining whether the player can get into certain sports clubs. The longer you are in a sports club, and higher your athleticism is. It might also be possible to boost athleticism by going to the gym.
Having bad grades or not practicing harder for certain clubs may cause you to get kicked out of the club.
