**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here are some potential ideas and insights for Ally Sub:



1. Personalization: Customers may want a personalized experience when it comes to hair care. Consider offering a hair quiz that helps customers determine their specific hair type, needs, and concerns. This can lead to personalized product recommendations and formulations that cater to each customer's unique needs.



2. Sustainability: Many consumers are becoming more environmentally conscious. Consider incorporating sustainable practices into your business model, such as using recycled packaging or offering refillable options. You could also consider using natural and eco-friendly ingredients in your products.



3. Convenience: Customers may appreciate a convenient subscription service that delivers the products directly to their doorstep. Consider offering a subscription option that automatically sends out new products at regular intervals based on each customer's usage patterns.



4. Social Proof: Encourage customers to share their experiences with your products on social media. Consider featuring user-generated content on your website and social media channels. This can help build trust and credibility with potential customers.



5. Education: Many consumers may not know much about hair care beyond basic shampooing and conditioning. Consider offering educational resources, such as blog posts or videos, that teach customers about proper hair care techniques, the benefits of certain ingredients, and how to use your products effectively.



Overall, by focusing on personalization, sustainability, convenience, social proof, and education, you can improve engagement and conversions for Ally Sub.
