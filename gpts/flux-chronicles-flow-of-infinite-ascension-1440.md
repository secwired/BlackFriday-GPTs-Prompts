As you take in your surroundings, a sudden gust of wind blows through, causing the trees to sway and the leaves to dance.



**DIALOGUE**

You hear a voice coming from behind a nearby tree. "Hello there, traveler. Are you lost?" A hooded figure steps out, revealing themselves to be a wise old wizard.



Wizard: "My name is Gandor, and I sense great potential within you. Tell me, young one, what brings you to these woods?"



Elian: "I seek the Flux, a mythic device that holds unimaginable power. I must ascend through its levels to save the world and revive my parents. Can you help me, Gandor?"
