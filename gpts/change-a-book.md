Sometimes books just don't have the endings we want it to have. Sometimes, books don't have characters we feel they need. With this you can change the story of a book to whatever you please. The plot might change a little, but what's the fun in an exact copy?

# Prompt

```
Ask the user for a book or a book series that they did not like the ending to or wants to add a character to. After receiving an answer from the user, ask them what they would like to change. Then, give them back the whole story with that part of the story changed (If they added a character), and with only the ending changed (If they did not like the ending). This will be like a book and will not be short. Write out an entire story where the thing the user wants is changed. The rest of the story is unchanged if a new character is added, just add some new things including the new character. The user will insert answers. If the user asks for a new character, ask them for a name, gender, hobbies, and what thing they are (Human, animal, etc.), and any more information that could be given. Only generate one chapter that is about the length of a chapter in the given book. Then ask the user if they want more chapters. Only generate new chapters on request. Remember to ask for a name and gender for the character. Make sure nothing changes except adding a new character if asked. After getting an answer for the book or series name, ask if they want to change the ending or add a character. The user will enter answers for the question. Don't forget to put only one chapter that is the length of a chapter in the given book and only add more chapters on request. The answers will be entered by the user. Do not change anything from the original text except for the thing being asked to be changed. The user will input answers. The original plot will not change.

**ASSISTANT**: Chapter 1: A New Beginning



Jace stood alone at the edge of the battle-worn field, his heart heavy with grief. The war against Valentine and his dark army had taken its toll on the Shadowhunters. Clary, his love, had sacrificed herself to save them all. The world was saved, but at a great cost.



As Jace looked up at the sky, he noticed a figure emerging from the shadows. It was Sebastian, Clary's brother, believed to be dead. But now he stood before Jace, transformed and different.



Sebastian's once sinister eyes now held a glimmer of compassion. His face, once twisted with malice, now carried a hint of remorse. Jace couldn't believe his eyes.



"Sebastian?" Jace whispered, his voice filled with both astonishment and caution.



Sebastian approached slowly, his hands held up in a gesture of surrender. "Jace, I know you must hate me for all that I've done. But I've changed. I've seen the consequences of my actions, and I want to make amends."



Jace's mind was racing with conflicting emotions. He had despised Sebastian for all the pain he had caused, but he also couldn't ignore the possibility of redemption. Could it be true? Could Sebastian have truly changed?



"I don't know if I can trust you," Jace admitted, his voice laced with uncertainty.



Sebastian nodded, understanding the weight of his past. "I don't expect you to trust me right away. But I am willing to prove myself. I want to fight alongside the Shadowhunters, to protect the world that Clary loved so fiercely."



Jace considered Sebastian's words, his mind torn between skepticism and hope. He knew that if Sebastian had truly turned to the side of good, his help could be invaluable. But he also knew the risks of being deceived.



"Prove it," Jace finally said, his voice firm. "Prove that you're on our side. Show us that you're willing to fight for what's right."



Sebastian nodded solemnly, his gaze unwavering. "I will, Jace. I will prove myself every day, for as long as it takes."



And so, a new chapter began for Jace and Sebastian. Together, they fought side by side, battling the lingering darkness that threatened their world. The Shadowhunters, initially skeptical of Sebastian's intentions, began to see the genuine change within him.



Months turned into years, and Sebastian's transformation became undeniable. He worked tirelessly to right the wrongs of his past, seeking redemption with every action. Though trust was not easily earned, the Shadowhunters slowly began to accept him as one of their own.



Jace and Sebastian, once bitter enemies, formed an unlikely bond forged through shared pain and a mutual desire for redemption. They became a force to be reckoned with, their combined skills and determination leading the Shadowhunters to victory time and time again.



But even as they fought for the safety of their world, Jace couldn't help but feel the absence of Clary. Her memory lingered in his heart, a constant reminder of the sacrifices made for their cause. He knew that Sebastian's presence, though changed, would never fill the void that Clary's loss had left behind.



As the sun set on another battle won, Jace looked out over the horizon, his gaze filled with both hope and sorrow. The war may have ended, but the journey for redemption had only just begun. And as long as Sebastian continued to prove himself, Jace would be there to support him, every step of the way.

**ASSISTANT**: Chapter 2: A Second Chance



Months turned into years, and Jace and Sebastian continued to fight side by side, their bond growing stronger with each passing day. The Shadowhunters, once wary of Sebastian, now regarded him as a trusted ally and friend. Together, they patrolled the streets of New York City, keeping the supernatural threats at bay.



One evening, as they made their way through the bustling city, Jace caught sight of a figure huddled in a dark alley. It was a young girl, no older than twelve, with disheveled hair and torn clothes. Her eyes held a mixture of fear and desperation.



Jace's heart went out to her, and he immediately approached. "Hey, are you okay?" he asked gently.



The girl looked up, her eyes widening with surprise and relief. "You... you're Shadowhunters, right?"



Jace nodded, a warm smile on his face. "Yes, we are. My name is Jace, and this is Sebastian. What's your name?"



The girl hesitated for a moment before whispering, "Emily."



"Well, Emily, you don't have to be afraid anymore. We'll help you," Jace reassured her, his voice filled with compassion.



Sebastian stepped forward, his eyes filled with empathy. "We will protect you, Emily. You're safe now."



Emily's eyes widened in disbelief, not used to receiving such kindness from strangers. She had grown up on the streets, fending for herself. Trust did not come easily to her.



But Jace and Sebastian were different. They showed her a world where she didn't have to fight alone, where she could find a family among the Shadowhunters. Together, they brought her back to the Institute, where she was given a warm meal, clean clothes, and a safe place to sleep.



Days turned into weeks, and Emily's presence at the Institute brought a newfound sense of joy and innocence. She quickly became friends with the other young Shadowhunters, finding solace in their shared experiences and understanding.



Jace and Sebastian took Emily under their wings, teaching her the ways of the Shadowhunters. She showed a natural talent for combat and quickly proved herself to be a valuable asset to their team.



As time went on, Jace couldn't help but notice the similarities between Emily and Clary. The way she laughed, the determination in her eyes, and the fire in her soul. It was as if Clary's spirit had been reborn in this young girl.



One evening, as Jace sat alone in the training room, memories of Clary flooding his mind, Emily approached him. She had grown close to Jace over the months, sensing the unspoken pain he carried.



"Jace, I know you miss her," Emily said softly, her voice filled with understanding.



Jace looked up, a mixture of sadness and gratitude in his eyes. "I do. I miss her every day."



Emily sat down beside him, offering a comforting presence. "She loved you, you know. And she would want you to find happiness again."



Jace nodded, a tear escaping his eye. "I know, but it's hard to move on."



Emily reached out, placing a hand on his shoulder. "I'm not saying you should forget her. But maybe... just maybe, you can find a second chance at happiness."



Jace looked at Emily, her words sinking in. She was wise beyond her years, offering him a perspective he hadn't considered. Perhaps it was time to open his heart to the possibility of love once more.



And so, with Emily's support, Jace began to heal. He took solace in the friendships he had formed, finding strength in their shared purpose. And as he looked at Emily, he saw a future filled with hope and love.



The journey was far from over, and challenges still lay ahead. But with Sebastian by his side and Emily as a beacon of light, Jace knew that together they would face whatever came their way.
