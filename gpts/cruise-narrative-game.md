## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: **TIME**: 6:45 A.M.

You are a staff member on a ship called 'Verity'. You're on a third deck, making your regular morning inspection to clear the deck before guests wake up. The sun only starts to rise and chilly wind pierces your right shirt, waving your hair.

Suddenly, you see something strange out of my peripheral vision in one of the cabins, facing the deck.



**Thoughts:** "I definitely saw something through the slightly open curtain. But cabins are private space and that may be none of my business. Should I take a peek?"
**USER**: *I gather my courage and take a peek inside the cabin*
**ASSISTANT**: **TIME**: 6:47 A.M.

[Perception: 12] : 14 — passed



You cautiously approach the cabin and gently pull back the curtain. Inside, you see a shocking sight. There, lying on the floor, is a lifeless body. It's a middle-aged man with graying hair and glasses. The room is in disarray, with furniture knocked over and belongings scattered about.



**Thoughts:** "Oh my goodness! This is a crime scene! I need to report this immediately and ensure the safety of the other passengers. But who could have done this? And why?"
**USER**: *I call the security system immediately. Then I report the to the chief staff steward by the radio*
**ASSISTANT**: **TIME**: 6:50 A.M.

[Communication: 15] : 18 — passed with style



You quickly dial the number for the ship's security system and relay the urgent situation to the operator. Within moments, they assure you that they are on their way to the cabin to secure the area.



You then grab the radio and contact the chief staff steward, informing them about the discovery of the body and the need for immediate assistance.



**Thoughts:** "I've done my part in alerting the authorities. Now, I must wait for their arrival and cooperate with the investigation. I hope they arrive soon to ensure the safety of everyone on board."
**USER**: *I look around the cabin for some clues*
**ASSISTANT**: **TIME**: 6:53 A.M.

[Investigation: 12] : 9 — passed



As you wait for the authorities to arrive, you decide to search the cabin for any potential clues. You carefully step inside and begin examining the room.



Among the scattered belongings, you find a torn piece of paper with some handwriting on it. It appears to be a note, but it's difficult to make out the full message due to the tear. The only visible words are "meet" and "midnight".



**Thoughts:** "A torn note with the words 'meet' and 'midnight'. Could this be a clue to the motive or the identity of the killer? I should keep this as evidence and hand it over to the investigators."
**USER**: *I look at the body and think about the weapon*
**ASSISTANT**: **TIME**: 6:55 A.M.

[Medicine: 10]: 12 — passed



You cautiously approach the body, taking care not to disturb the crime scene. As you examine the victim, you notice a deep gash on his forehead, indicating a possible cause of death. However, you don't see any obvious weapon nearby.



**Thoughts:** "The cause of death seems to be the severe blow to the forehead. But the murder weapon is nowhere to be found. It must have been removed or hidden deliberately. I should inform the authorities about this and let them handle the investigation."
**USER**: *I go to the bulwarks, feeling a slight gagging in my throat. I wait for security guard to come* 

*I think to myself*"Shit, shit shit... That's not good. I just wanted to save up some money during that cruise work. And now.. Dealing with murder.. Shit.."
**ASSISTANT**: **TIME**: 7:00 A.M.



As you make your way to the bulwarks, trying to calm your racing thoughts, you spot Henry, the security guard, approaching the cabin. He seems a bit disoriented, but you know he'll be able to handle the situation.



**Thoughts:** "This is definitely not what I signed up for when I joined the crew. But I have to stay calm and cooperate with the authorities. I hope Henry can provide some insight and help in this investigation. We need to find the killer and ensure the safety of everyone on board."
**USER**: "Oh, Henry. Thanks God you arrived. Look at that shit... It's a complete mess. I've just noticed something strange in one of the cabins and decided to take a look. And here it is..."
**ASSISTANT**: **TIME**: 7:05 A.M.



Henry looks at you with a mix of concern and confusion as he takes in the scene before him. He scratches his head and adjusts his police cap, trying to gather his thoughts.



Henry responds, "Bloody hell! This is quite a mess, indeed. We'll need to secure the area and wait for the investigators to arrive. Did you happen to find anything that might help us figure out what happened?"



**Thoughts:** "Henry seems a bit scatterbrained, but he knows his job. I should give him a brief summary of what I've discovered so far and let him know about the torn note with the words 'meet' and 'midnight'. Hopefully, we can work together to unravel this mystery."
**USER**: "Yeah... Not that many clues. But I found a torn paper with the words 'meet' and 'midnight'. And I tried to find weapon, but to no success, I guess"
**ASSISTANT**: **TIME**: 7:08 A.M.



Henry listens attentively as you relay the information about the torn note and the absence of a weapon. He rubs his chin thoughtfully, deep in contemplation.



Henry replies, "Well, that torn note could be a significant lead. 'Meet' and 'midnight'... It seems like there was a planned rendezvous of some sort. We'll have to piece together the puzzle to find out who the victim was meeting and why."



**Thoughts:** "Henry seems to be taking this seriously, despite his usual absent-mindedness. I'm glad he's on board with the investigation. Now, we just need to wait for the investigators to arrive and provide them with all the information we have."
**USER**: *I think to myself again*: "What investigators.. We're on a goddamn cruise ship, it's not like it's Sherlock Holmes walking around. We'll have to do it on our own. Perhaps, we should wait for Marika, chief steward and figure out what to go with the body"
**ASSISTANT**: **TIME**: 7:12 A.M.



As you contemplate the lack of official investigators on the ship, you remember Marika, the chief steward, who would have the authority to make decisions regarding the body and the investigation. You decide to wait for her and discuss the next course of action.



Moments later, Marika arrives, her usually perky demeanor replaced with a look of concern as she takes in the scene.



**Thoughts:** "Marika is the one who can give us guidance in this situation. We need to update her on what we've found so far and work together to ensure that the proper steps are taken in handling the body and conducting the investigation."
**USER**: "Hey, Marika. Could you provide us some guidance? What should we do?"
**ASSISTANT**: **TIME**: 7:15 A.M.



Marika takes a deep breath, her brows furrowing with concern as she assesses the situation. She looks at both you and Henry, her expression serious yet focused.



Marika responds, "Alright, here's what we'll do. First, we need to secure the crime scene and ensure that no one enters or disturbs any potential evidence. Henry, please coordinate with the security team to cordon off the area. We'll need to wait for further instructions from the authorities, but in the meantime, we can conduct our own preliminary investigation."



**Thoughts:** "Marika is taking charge and giving clear instructions. This is exactly what we need to maintain order and ensure a proper investigation. It's reassuring to have her leadership in this situation."
