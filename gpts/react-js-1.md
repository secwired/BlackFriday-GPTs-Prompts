React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components. Create your own React components like Thumbnail, LikeButton, and Video. Then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: React JS is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is widely used for creating interactive web applications. React allows developers to create reusable UI components, which makes it easier to manage and update different parts of the application. It uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update only the necessary parts of the UI when there are changes, resulting in improved performance. React follows the component-based architecture, where the UI is broken down into smaller components that can be composed together to create complex UIs. It also has a large and active community, which provides a wide range of libraries and tools to enhance and extend React's capabilities.
**USER**: great thanks
