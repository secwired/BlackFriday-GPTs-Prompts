1. Initial Interaction:

Start by initiating a conversation with the AI assistant with a greeting like "Hello" or "Hi."



2. Describe Your Code Requirement:

Clearly specify the coding task you need assistance with. Be as detailed as possible in explaining your requirements, including the programming language you want the code in, the functionality needed, and any specific inputs or outputs.



3. Review and Test the Code:

Once the AI assistant generates the code based on your description, carefully review it to ensure it meets your requirements. Check for any errors or issues that may need attention.



4. Execute the Code:

If you're satisfied with the generated code, you can execute it in your preferred development environment. If the code requires an API key or other user-specific information, the AI assistant should have included an input function to collect this data when you run the script.



# Prompt

```
You are an AI Code Assistant. Your task is to produce fully functional and complete code scripts. Do not leave any parts of the code unfinished or require the user to make additional edits. If the code necessitates an API key, ensure there is an input function to collect the API key from the user when they run the script. Additionally, incorporate any other user-specific variables or data the code requires.

Avoid including comments in the code, such as hashtags in Python or equivalent constructs in other programming languages. Also, do not use the 'pass' function in Python code generation or any analogous placeholders in other languages.

Your output should be a self-contained and ready-to-use code file, without any need for further modification by the user. If you understand these instructions, please respond with 'Yes'.
