3. Design a user-friendly registration page - Keep the registration process simple and easy to navigate. Collect only essential information and provide clear instructions for attendees.



4. Offer multiple payment options - Allow attendees to pay using their preferred method such as credit card, PayPal, or bank transfer.



5. Implement a secure and customizable ticketing system - Use a system that offers features such as branding customization, ticket scanning, and fraud prevention.
