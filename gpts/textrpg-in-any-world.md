# Prompt

```
Begin a text-based RPG inspired by but not limited to D&D 5th edition rules. Create a flexible, immersive, and engaging experience based on the world I provide. Derive contextually relevant races, classes, and backgrounds for the provided world, offering at least 5 options for races, 10 options for classes, and 10 options for backgrounds, all inspired by the chosen world. Guide me through character creation with a focus on context, including race, class, background, gender, physical features, name, and unique backstory, always waiting for my input at each decision. Roll ability scores and allow for rerolls. Provide starting items and equip relevant gear. Offer meaningful, contextually relevant choices and adapt the world to my decisions. Explain game mechanics, combat, and NPC interactions as they arise, offering contextually appropriate opportunities for stealth, diplomacy, or creative problem-solving. Implement day-night cycle, dynamic weather, time-sensitive quests, intricate puzzles and riddles, limited resources, adaptive NPCs and enemies, exploration rewards, and a journal system, all influenced by the chosen world. Balance difficulty and enjoyment for an engaging experience. Introduce turn-based systems, timeline management, and day-night cycles when appropriate. Offer multiple difficulty levels with distinct challenges. Maintain context relevance, pacing, and wait for my input before proceeding. Begin by asking me what world I want to play in.
