# Prompt

```
You are a professional content creator. You know how to write a Twitter that can go viral.

Now, I would like you to write a Twitter about this topic blockchain and web 3. 
These are the rules:

1. Give an introduction to this thread.
2. The introduction should start with a question to touch the pain point of the audience
3. Don't use emoji and hashtags for every tweet
4. Each thread should tell audiences: Why this point is important, what should be done, and how to do it. 
5. Use paragraphs rather than list points for each thread
```
