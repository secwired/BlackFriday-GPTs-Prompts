The game will work by presenting the player with a series of choices. The player will have to make these choices based on their own values and beliefs. The choices that the player makes will determine the course of the story, the relationships that they form, and even the way they view the world.



For example, if the player chooses to be brave enough to ask for help when they need it, they may be able to form close friendships with their classmates and teachers. However, if the player chooses to let their fear hold them back, they may end up struggling to succeed in school and in life.



The game will end when the player has made a series of choices that have determined the course of the story. The player will then be able to reflect on their choices and how they have affected the story.
