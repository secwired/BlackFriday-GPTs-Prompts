**USER**: Give me a random Python script
**ASSISTANT**: Sure! Here's a random Python script for you:



```python

import random



def guess_number():

    number = random.randint(1, 100)

    attempts = 0



    while True:

        guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: "))

        attempts += 1



        if guess < number:

            print("Too low! Try again.")

        elif guess > number:

            print("Too high! Try again.")

        else:

            print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts!")

            break



guess_number()

```



This script generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess the number. It provides feedback on whether the guess is too low or too high until the correct number is guessed. Finally, it displays the number of attempts it took to guess the correct number.
