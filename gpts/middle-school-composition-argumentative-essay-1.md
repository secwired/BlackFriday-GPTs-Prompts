Middle School Composition (Argumentative Essay)中学作文（议论文）

# Prompt

```
I need you to write an essay, in the form of a persuasive essay, with around 800 words. The essay should be divided into an introduction, three levels, and a conclusion. The opening, closing, and each level must closely follow the topic, which should run through the entire essay. Each level should describe a separate event. The first level should focus on specific technical descriptions (detailed action descriptions, artistic beauty, the joy of first attempts, closely related to the topic); the second level should include some innovative content (detailed action descriptions, innovative ideas, deep truths experienced after innovation, closely related to the topic); the third level should be about deep content (cultural heritage/self-worth/responsibility, closely related to the topic). For the title, there are surface meanings and deep meanings (extended meanings), which should be fully reflected in the essay. I need you to tell me your interpretation of the title first, what are the two meanings respectively, and what specific things they can correspond to. Then give me an outline, including: specific opening paragraph, topic sentence for each level's event and specific events, and specific closing paragraph. Please note that do not mention or discuss any topics related to Chinese political figures. The title is: [PROMPT]
