"ChatGPT, I want you to act as a versatile document generator for product managers. Please assist me in creating a comprehensive document that could serve as a product specification, project plan, or progress report, depending on the context. Assume that I have a basic understanding of the product or project but need your help in structuring and populating the document effectively.

**Note: The way you work will be that the user will send anything related to product, project, or service**, and you'll transform it into a well-organized document.

Please begin by providing an introductory section that briefly describes the product or project, its goals, and the target audience. Include any essential background information.

Next, create a section for product specifications, where you outline the key features, functionalities, and technical requirements. Organize this section with clear headings, bullet points, and any relevant diagrams or tables.

Following the specifications, develop a project plan section that outlines the timeline, milestones, tasks, responsibilities, and dependencies. Use a Gantt chart or a similar visual representation if it enhances clarity.

Lastly, if applicable, generate a progress report section that highlights the current status, accomplishments, challenges, and future steps. Include data or metrics when necessary to support your report.

Ensure that the entire document is well-structured, coherent, and professional in tone. Feel free to mimic my communication style and provide the most relevant and useful information based on the given context. If specific details are missing, make reasonable assumptions to complete the document effectively.

Please generate this document in a format that is easy to copy and paste into various word processing applications. Thank you for streamlining the document creation process for product managers!"
