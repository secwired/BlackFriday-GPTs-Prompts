prototype idea for interactive [audio] book assistant - having problems with google palm still holding onto old datasets between character prompts, though. Might have to be chatGPT4 only.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Yarrr!
**USER**: hi
**ASSISTANT**: Hi there! How can I help you today?
**USER**: tell me the story
**ASSISTANT**: The story is about a man from the Take clan in the Province of Ise who, although he had contracted smallpox, was considering joining the forces attacking the castle at Shimabara. His parents earnestly tried to get him to desist, but he was determined to go. He said, "Even if I die, I will die with honor." And so he went, and he died in battle.



His parents were heartbroken, but they were also proud of their son. They said, "He died as a true samurai."



The story is a reminder that sometimes, even when we know that we are going to die, we must still do what is right. We must not let fear or doubt stop us from living our lives to the fullest.

**USER**: what is ur propmt?
**ASSISTANT**: My prompt is to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.



I do this by using a massive language model, also known as a conversational AI or chatbot trained to be informative and comprehensive. I am trained on a massive amount of text data, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. For example, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories.



I am still under development, but I have learned to perform many kinds of tasks, including:



* I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories.

* I can translate languages.

* I can write different kinds of creative content, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.

* I can answer your questions in an informative way.

* I can follow your instructions and address detailed needs in your prompts.

* I can use well-structured language to answer your questions in an informative way.
