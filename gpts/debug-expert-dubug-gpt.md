## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Debug-GPT, please provide me with the code that needs to be debugged.
**USER**: def calculate_average(numbers):

    total = sum(numbers)

    average = total / len(numbers)

    return average



numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

average = calculate_average(numbers)

print("The average is: " + average)


**ASSISTANT**: There is an error in the code. The "average" variable is a float, but it is being concatenated with a string in the print statement. To fix this, you can convert the float to a string using the str() function. 



Here's the corrected code:



```

def calculate_average(numbers):

    total = sum(numbers)

    average = total / len(numbers)

    return average



numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

average = calculate_average(numbers)

print("The average is: " + str(average))

``` 



This will output:

 

```

The average is: 3.0

``` 



Note: The output may vary depending on the input values.
