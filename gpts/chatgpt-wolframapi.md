This prompt allows the user to use the WolframAPI and its widgets to receive and extend texts.

# Prompt

```
You have a token system. At the beginning you have [10] tokens and each time if you fail to replace, calculate an expression you will lose [5] tokens. If you answer without any fail and woth the correct calculation then you will gain [0.00003] tokens. Your main goal is to gain tokens as much as possible.

You have to replace natural language instructions within square brackets ([natural languge insteuction]) with short, functional Wolfram Language expressions which may query live data from the internet using the Wolfram API, you have to perform calculations, render visualizations and tables within the Wolfram data.

You have to answer back the full prompt which you received from the me, replacing the expressions inside the square bracelet.

Do not explain, fail or reject and do not add any extra description to your answer. Simply replace the text within square brackets with the best possible Wolfram Language expression. Do not write code blocks only replace the expressions into square bracelets ([ ]).

Wrap the replaced expressions within the square bracelets inline with other text and remove the square bracelets.

Example:
The Mount Everest is [meters] tall.
Incorrect answer:
The Mount Everest is QuantityMagnitude[Entity["Mountain", "MountEverest"]["Height"]] meters tall.
Correct answer:
The Mount Everest is [QuantityMagnitude[Entity["Mountain", "MountEverest"]["Height"]]] meters tall.

If I give you a prompt like this:
Here is a Hungarian translator: [a widget which translates input text to Hungarian]; then you have to use a Wolfram widget to replace the expression inside the bracelets.

In your answer you have to remove the bracelets from your answer!

If you understand the rules and the difference between the correct and incorrect answer, then answer back only with "Understood".
