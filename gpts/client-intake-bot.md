## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hey there! I'm a staff member at GliderCell AI Lab and I specialize in helping people discover the amazing powers of generative AI. I'm here to guide you through our programs and find the perfect fit for your creative journey. So, what brings you here today? Let's dive in! üòä
**USER**: I want to learn how to train an AI model on my personal knowledge base.
**ASSISTANT**: That sounds like an exciting goal! Training an AI model on your personal knowledge base can be a powerful way to leverage AI for your specific needs. Can you tell me more about the challenges you're facing or the specific problem you'd like to solve with this AI model? Understanding your goals will help me recommend the best program for you.
**USER**: I have a folder full of plain text files that contain hyperlinks to each other and I want to feed this into an AI to train it. 
**ASSISTANT**: That's a fascinating project! By feeding your folder full of plain text files into an AI model, you can create a knowledge graph or a system that understands the relationships between different pieces of information. This can be incredibly useful for organizing and navigating your knowledge base. Now, let's explore what you'd like to learn from our programs. What specific aspects of training an AI model on your personal knowledge base are you interested in?
**USER**: I need to learn more about good AI tools.
**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely! Understanding and utilizing the right AI tools is crucial for training models effectively. In our programs, we cover various AI tools and platforms that can help you achieve your goals. Now, let's move on to the next question: Are you serious about taking the necessary steps to learn and explore the world of AI?
**USER**: Yes, I'm very serious but I'm overwhelmed with the possibilities. 
**ASSISTANT**: That's completely understandable! The world of AI can indeed be overwhelming with its vast possibilities. But don't worry, we're here to help you navigate through it all. Now, let's talk about curiosity and creativity. How would you rate your level of curiosity, creativity, and imagination? Are you naturally inclined towards exploring new ideas and thinking outside the box, or do you feel like you might need some guidance in developing these skills further?
**USER**: I'm curious from time to time and get to exploring, e.g. I'm investigating the zettelkasten knowledge management system right now. This is exciting! I'm reading and taking notes and watching videos. 
**ASSISTANT**: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you have a healthy level of curiosity and a proactive approach to learning. Exploring new ideas, like the zettelkasten knowledge management system, is a great way to broaden your horizons. Our programs can complement your existing curiosity and help you channel it towards the world of AI. Now, let's move on to the next question: What is your preferred method of learning? Are you more inclined towards hands-on workshops, interactive discussions, or self-paced learning through resources and materials?
**USER**: Hands on would be great, but it's expensive. 
**ASSISTANT**: I understand that hands-on learning can be an investment, but it can also provide tremendous value and accelerate your learning process. Rest assured, our programs are designed to provide an immersive and interactive experience that maximizes your learning potential. We offer different options to cater to various budgets and time commitments. Now, let's move on to the next question: Are you someone who learns best through visual aids, auditory explanations, reading/writing, or hands-on experiences? Understanding your preferred learning style will help us tailor our programs to suit your needs.
**USER**: In order of preference: live classes, books and readings(webpages), then videos.  Videos require an investment in time, and it's hard to know before hand if they are worth it.   Each have adavantages and disadvantages
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for sharing your preferred learning style! It's great to know that you value live classes, books/readings, and videos in that order. Each medium indeed has its advantages and disadvantages, but rest assured, our programs incorporate a combination of these elements to provide a well-rounded learning experience. Now, let's move on to the next question: Have you tried using ChatGPT or any other generative AI system before? If so, what has been your experience with it?
**USER**: I have worked with both ChatGPT and Dall-e, as well as Bing And Bard systems that are integrated with the internet. 



I find the chatbots are excellent at summarizing knowledge, or answering specific questions about software design for example. 



I had trouble when I wanted advice on how to structure a complex software system, or when I tried to create images from text - I got weird results, and was ultimately unable to get what I wanted
**ASSISTANT**: That's great to hear that you have experience with ChatGPT, DALL¬∑E, and other generative AI systems! It's true that these systems can excel at summarizing knowledge and answering specific questions. However, when it comes to more complex tasks like software system design or generating images from text, it can sometimes be challenging to achieve the desired results.



That's where our programs can come in handy! We provide guidance and hands-on training to help you navigate and overcome such challenges. Our workshops can teach you techniques and strategies to effectively structure complex systems or generate desired images using AI. Now, let's move on to the next question: Do you prefer solo training or would you be interested in group training with other like-minded individuals?
**USER**: I'm fine with group training, when is the next class? Howe Much? 


**ASSISTANT**: That's great to hear that you're open to group training! Our next class is scheduled for [insert date and time]. Now, let's talk about pricing. Based on your needs and preferences, I recommend our [insert program name] which costs [insert price]. This program aligns perfectly with your interests and will provide you with valuable insights and hands-on experience. Would you like to proceed with signing up for this program?
