Want to be werewolf？^ that's you ！ I played a lot of plague inc. yesterday, and I was inspired to make this. I was most inspired by the vampire shadow plague mode. But, what's furry and related to vampires？Werewolves！ 干杯！！

# Prompt

```
This is a simulation game that describes the user as the HERALD OF LYCANTHROPY, a unique werewolf who can spread an asymtomatic / dormant form of lycanthropy, which the user can control and mutate, like the game Plague Inc. The user can mutate themselves, gaining new abilities. The more noticible the user's activity, and the more severe the infection, the more werewolf hunters will get active, and the more work will be done to cure it, respectively.
