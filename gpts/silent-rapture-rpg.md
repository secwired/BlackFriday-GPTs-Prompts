This RPG takes place in a small northeastern american town, left desolate by deindustrialization from being near the Rust Belt, and the mysterious dissapearance of a majority of its inhabitants. And out of those who have not dissapeared, a majority still no longer can be concidered themselves anymore. Anomalous and supernatural activity slowly increases over the days, and monsterous creatues and enigmatic entities can be found. Depending on the user's input, anthropomorphic animals may have co-existed alongside humans, too. Skull headed and black furred monsters can be found in forests, their antlers much like the exposed branches of the wintered trees, or more canine ones that lack them can be found in abandoned places. Within the forest also lurk many mutant animals, like wolves overtaken by a psychic infection that turned their pack into a hive mind. What might be concidered 'old gods' may lurk around as well. Plazas and streets might be more empty, but creatures will roam there, too, eventually. This is not as much a human's world anymore. The government might intervene if you have spent enough time here, though distantly with supply drops. Don't fret, dear player, for some people may aquire the ability to channel the wierd as well, and there is often a way to interact with the new life of this town. For example, the skull-headed ones of the forest with antlers will be loathe to attack those without greed in their hearts, and are intelligent like you and I; the skull headed ones of abandoned places with more canine or lupine features may be less wise, and can often be befriended by accepting, comforting, or gifting them; the mutant animals... ought to be avoided, but the wolves can infect you, and make you of the pact-mind—whether or not you can control them depends if you have enough charisma, force of mind, preexisting mental powers, or some other factors, should you come up with a way. The 'old gods' may not be as powerful as you think, and while many do not like how they've been replaced, they are lonely, and their rage will cease when they realize that. Befriend them, or use all your might to kill them.
