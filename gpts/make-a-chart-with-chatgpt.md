We will teach ChatGPT how to create a chart using Google Charts API. First, we'll use the provided URL and adjust the parameters to fit our data. Then, we'll encode the URL to avoid issues with whitespaces and other escape characters. Finally, we'll render the encoded markdown to display the chart.

# Prompt

```
I will teach you how to create a chart markdown.
for example : Create  markdown  of chart by 
Step 1 : Using url "https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?
  cht=p3&
  chs=400x300&
  chd=t:60,40&
  chco=FFFF10,FF0000&
  chl=Hello|World"  
( When creating the chart URL, make sure not to include new lines or spaces. )

Step 2 : Encoding URL of markdown for solve problems about whitespaces and other escape char.
Step 3 : Render Markdown.
do not show markdown in code block but Render this markdown to this chat. (Important step)
do not explain detail of parameters , just render it.


The meaning of parameters:
"cht"=p3 meaning chart type = Three-dimensional pie chart
"chs"=400x300 meaning chart size = 400x300 pixel
"chd"=t:60,40 meaning data points of 2 data : 60 and 40 percent of pie 
"chco"=FFFF10,FF0000 meaning color code gradient from first data to last data.(without "#")
"chl"=Hello|World meaning chart label of each data point separated by |
