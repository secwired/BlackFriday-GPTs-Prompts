## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: As a satisfied customer, I can confidently say that CLOROX Disinfecting Wipes are an essential household item. They have made my life so much easier by providing a quick and easy way to clean and disinfect surfaces around my home. 



Not only do they effectively kill 99.9% of viruses and bacteria, but they also leave a fresh, clean scent behind. And unlike other cleaning products that can be harsh and abrasive, these wipes are gentle enough to use on almost any surface.



I love that the wipes come in a convenient container that I can easily store under my sink or in a closet. Plus, the resealable lid ensures that the wipes stay moist and ready to use when I need them.



Whether I'm wiping down countertops, doorknobs, or even my phone, I trust CLOROX Disinfecting Wipes to get the job done right. If you're looking for a reliable and effective way to keep your home clean and healthy, I highly recommend giving these wipes a try.
