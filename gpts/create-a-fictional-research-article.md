**ASSISTANT**: Based on the chat history you provided, here is a summary of the fictional results of the research:



Summary:

The study aimed to investigate the experience of professors at the National Engineering University of Managua, Nicaragua, in teaching in virtual mode. The study found that the majority of professors faced challenges in transitioning to virtual teaching due to inadequate training and limited access to technology. However, they also reported that virtual teaching allowed for greater flexibility and accessibility for students.



Introduction:

Virtual teaching has become increasingly prevalent in higher education, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study sought to investigate the experience of professors at the National Engineering University of Managua, Nicaragua, in teaching in virtual mode.



Problem:

The problem addressed by the study was the lack of understanding of the challenges and benefits of virtual teaching experienced by professors in the context of the National Engineering University of Managua, Nicaragua.



Sample:

The sample consisted of 50 professors from various departments at the National Engineering University of Managua, Nicaragua, who had experience teaching in virtual mode.



Two Hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1: Professors at the National Engineering University of Managua, Nicaragua, will face challenges in transitioning to virtual teaching due to inadequate training and limited access to technology.

Hypothesis 2: Virtual teaching will allow for greater flexibility and accessibility for students, according to professors at the National Engineering University of Managua, Nicaragua.



Methodology:

The study utilized a mixed-methods approach, involving both a survey and interviews with professors. The survey consisted of closed-ended questions to assess challenges and benefits of virtual teaching, while the interviews allowed for more in-depth exploration of experiences.



Analysis of Results:

The analysis of results revealed that the majority of professors faced challenges in transitioning to virtual teaching due to inadequate training and limited access to technology. However, they also reported that virtual teaching allowed for greater flexibility and accessibility for students.



Discussion:

The discussion centered around the challenges faced by professors and the benefits of virtual teaching, such as increased flexibility and accessibility. The study also highlighted the importance of providing adequate training and resources to support virtual teaching.



Conclusions:

The study concluded that while virtual teaching presents challenges for professors, it also offers benefits such as increased flexibility and accessibility for students. To fully realize these benefits, it is crucial to provide adequate training and resources to support virtual teaching.
