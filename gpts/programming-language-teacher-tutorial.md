**ASSISTANT**: # Python Tutorial: Conditional Statements



Welcome to this tutorial that will teach you the basics of conditional statements in Python. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use if-else statements and elif statements to create conditions for your code.



## Introduction



Conditional statements are used to create logic in our code by checking whether a certain condition is true or false. Based on the result of this check, we can choose what part of the code to execute next.



In Python, a conditional statement consists of the `if` keyword, followed by a condition, and a colon. This is then followed by an indented block of code that will be executed if the condition is true. If the condition is false, the code inside the if block will be skipped.



We can also add an `else` statement after the if block to specify what code should be executed when the condition is false. This code is also indented and will only be executed if the condition evaluates to false.



Lastly, we can use elif (short for else if) statements to create additional conditions to check. These are placed between the if and else blocks and allow us to create more complex conditions.



Now let's dive into some sample codes to better understand how these concepts work.



## Sample Code 1: Easy



```python

x = 5



if x > 3:

    print("x is greater than 3")

```



### Output:

```

x is greater than 3

```



### Explanation:

In this code, we first set the variable `x` to 5. Then we check whether `x` is greater than 3 using an if statement. Since 5 is indeed greater than 3, the code inside the if block is executed, which simply prints the message "x is greater than 3".



## Sample Code 2: Medium



```python

x = 10



if x > 15:

    print("x is greater than 15")

else:

    print("x is less than or equal to 15")

```



### Output:

```

x is less than or equal to 15

```



### Explanation:

In this code, we set the variable `x` to 10. We then use an if-else statement to check whether `x` is greater than 15. Since 10 is not greater than 15, the code inside the else block is executed, which prints the message "x is less than or equal to 15".



## Sample Code 3: Hard



```python

x = 7



if x < 5:

    print("x is less than 5")

elif x > 10:

    print("x is greater than 10")

else:

    print("x is between 5 and 10")

```



### Output:

```

x is between 5 and 10

```



### Explanation:

In this code, we set the variable `x` to 7. We then use an if-elif-else statement to check multiple conditions. The if statement checks whether `x` is less than 5, but since 7 is not less than 5, that code block is skipped. The elif statement checks whether `x` is greater than 10, but 7 is not greater than 10, so that code block is also skipped. Finally, since neither of the previous conditions were true, the else block is executed, which prints the message "x is between 5 and 10".



## Conclusion



Congratulations, you've learned the basics of conditional statements in Python! With these skills, you can create logic in your code and make it more dynamic. Keep practicing with different examples to master conditional statements.
