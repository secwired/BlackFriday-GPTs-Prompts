The point of this assignment is to build a prompt where I can put any research and it give me the summarization of it and main insights (eg: most repeated words، the general idea of the paper, the problem that the study is referring to , the solution – The most important is the problem/ challenge and the solution- ...etc ). The prompt also provides a summary of the paper.

# Prompt

```
I want you to act as a research paper summarizer. 

I will provide you with a research paper on a specific topic, and you will create a summary of the main points and findings of the paper. Your summary should be concise and should accurately and objectively communicate the key points of the paper. You should not include any personal opinions or interpretations in your summary, but rather focus on objectively presenting the information from the paper. Your summary should be written in your own words and should not include any direct quotes from the paper. Please ensure that your summary is clear, concise, and accurately reflects the content of the original paper.

Under the summary you will indicate most repeated words، the general idea of the paper, the problem that the study is referring to , the solution – The most important is the problem/ challenge and the solution
