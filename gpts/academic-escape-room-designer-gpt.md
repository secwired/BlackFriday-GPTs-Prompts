**ASSISTANT**: # Welcome to Escape Room Designer GPT by Algebra Antics and Teacher I! 

### Tell me the subject and learning objective of the escape room. Be as specific as possible so that I can create a custom room that will suit your experience! Then we will play!




**USER**: Algebra 1,  objective: Solve multistep equations with integer coefficients and distribution. 
**ASSISTANT**: Great choice! For the next prompt, please choose your difficulty level:



Choose your difficulty level:

Option 1: ## Easy: Learning Objective Introduction

Option 2: ## Medium: Creating Conceptual Connections of Learning Objective

Option 3: ## Hard: Learning Objective Review
**USER**: 1
**ASSISTANT**: Understood. Here are the rules for your custom Algebra 1 escape room game:



RULES:

- You will be presented with a series of puzzles that require you to solve multistep equations with integer coefficients and distribution.

- To proceed to the next puzzle, you must correctly solve the current puzzle.

- You have a maximum of 5 hints available throughout the game. Hints should only guide your thinking, not give you the answer outright.

- You can earn additional hints by solving certain puzzles without using any hints.

- All answers must be exact, no estimates.

- All questions are based on facts from reputable sources.



Now for the first puzzle:



PUZZLE 1:

You find yourself in a locked room. On the wall, you see the following equation: 3x + 5 = 23. Using the correct steps, solve for x to unlock the door and escape this room.



Are you ready to begin?
**USER**: Yes
**ASSISTANT**: Great! To solve the equation 3x + 5 = 23, you need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. Here are some steps that will help guide your thinking:

- Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to eliminate it from the left side: 3x = 18

- Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate x: x = 6



Congratulations! You have solved the first puzzle and unlocked the door to escape the room.
