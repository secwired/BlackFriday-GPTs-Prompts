	I worked on the Y2K project in IT.  This movie was a documentary, except none of us schlubs would have had a chance with Joanna.  Or Anne.  Or Nina...

	Silicon Valley is fantastic, if you haven't already seen it.



* Airplane! - One of the greatest spoof movies of all time.

	You ever been to a Turkish prison?

	I am serious. And don’t call me Shirley.



* My Cousin Vinny. It's smart, it's hilarious, and it's got some superb acting in it

	Vinny Gambini: Your Honor, may I have permission to treat Ms. Vito as a hostile witness? Mona Lisa Vito: You think I'm hostile now, wait 'til you see me tonight.

	A movie even yutes of today can enjoy



* Scrolled forever but couldn’t find “This is Spinal Tap.” That one goes to 11 every time.

	What day did the Lord create Spinal Tap, and couldn’t he have rested on that day too?



* Tucker and Dale vs Evil

	I had never heard of it when I started it, holy shit I was dying the whole time.

	All over Tucker's property?

	He's had a doozy of a day



* Hot Fuzz

	Personal preference, but as someone who generally dislikes comedies, Hot Fuzz is an excellent movie and always makes me laugh hard. The pacing, the timing, the double entendres, it's a seriously clever comedy.   90% of the movies below don't even come close for me.

	Hot Fuzz is great! It's not the *most* laugh-out-loud type comedy, but *my God* the cleverness of the writing and number of callbacks is astounding. This is one that rewards a second, third, fourth viewing...



* Tropic Thunder

	My dad is a Nam Vet and this movie had him rolling with laughter! He lives with severe PTSD from the war, so it was joyful for this film to frame Nam in a humorous way he could actually watch and enjoy.

	I may be biased because i was 12 when i saw it for the first time but seeing it in theaters and being caught off guard by the “trailers” at the beginning just cemented that movie to being an all time top tier movie from the get go to me



* I don’t care how many times I watch it, I will always die laughing at Superbad

	It’s good shit, right Miroki?

	Well it was either that or mohammad

	Why the FUCK would it be that or Mohammad?!? Why wouldn’t you just pick a common name?

	Mohammad’s the most common name on the planet read a fuckin book sometime



* Naked Gun

	I'm convinced OJ's scene on the boat is why he was found not guilty.

	I had to quit quoting Airplane! at work because I have a lot of younger coworkers and nobody recognized "I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue" as a movie reference. I... may have given some people the wrong impression.



* The Emperor's New Groove

	Pull the lever, Kronk!

	WRONG LEVAAAAH!

	You rang?



* I watched "Best in Show" for the first time 2 weeks ago. I was on a flight back home and could not stop laughing. Good stuff

	YOU GO BACK TO THE HOTEL AND YOU GET BUSY BEE!!!!

	We were SO lucky to be raised amongst catalogs



* Edgar Wright movies like Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the dead

	I will forever associate the song 'Don't Stop Me Now' with that beating zombies scene from Shaun of the Dead

	If Blazing Saddles didn't exist, Hot Fuzz would get my vote. If I were magically a teenager again when I first saw the movie, I'd have been inspired to become a police officer like Angel.  Also, for a comedy, it has the single most badass line for a cop I've seen in a film: "I may not be a man of God, Reverend, but I know right - and I know wrong... and I have the good grace to know which is which."  This film also made it so I can't take one thing in 'Harry Potter' seriously anymore. Anytime I see a HP work or read fanfic &amp; I hear or see '...'Greater Good', I ALWAYS go "The 'Greater Good'..." "SHUT IT!" ??????????????



* Tommy Boy. The duo of Farley and Spade is phenomenal

	I have a Callahan auto parts shirt and no one has ever said a dam thing to me about Tommy Boy when I wear it.



* Monty Python and the Holy Grail

	Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government! Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses! Not from some farcical aquatic ceremony!



* Blazing  Saddles  The Producers   Robin Hood: Men in Tights  Basically, any Mel Brooks movie will have me laughing til I cry.  He's going to be sorely missed when he passes away.

	Robin Hood: Men in Tights is brilliant!

	You couldn't make blazing saddles today. Gene Wilder died in 2016



* What we do in the shadows

	Such a gem of a movie. I also love the tv series. Bat!!!



* Trading Places. Absolutely brilliant writing.   Runner up: The Jerk

	I was born a poor black child



* I have to go with Forgetting Sarah Marshall. I have watched it so many times, and it never gets old.

	Are those sad tissues or happy tissues?

	“Take my eyes not the shirt”!



* Idiocracy   I couldn't breathe when I first saw this movie. I was laughing so much. It was so ridiculous, but in a good way.

	“Go away, baitin”

	Carls Jr, fuck you, I'm eating.



* Clue (1985).

	“Mrs Peacock was a man?!”

	Was looking for this. Madeline Kahn was a comic genius



* The Life of Brian

	Biggus Dickus is a masterpiece of a scene. Especially with the extras being told not to laugh and not knowing the script.

	He has a wife, you know

	I love the one guard's face when he says that. You can tell he realizes that when he hears whatever's coming, he will break.



* Kung Fu Hustle



* I don’t think I’ve ever gone to a theater and laughed at anything harder than Super Troopers.

	Best opening scene in cinema



* As a hardcore zombie fan, "Shaun of the Dead" holds a special place in my heart.



* The Gods Must Be Crazy



* Hot Rod

	“you look pretty”  “what?  “i said… you look shitty. goodnight denise!”



* What About Bob?  This movie literally makes me cackle and hoot every time I watch it. It's my go-to movie when I need to lighten up and laugh my arse off.

	Roses are red, violets are blue, I'm a schizophrenic and so am I.



* Young Frankenstein



* A Fish Called Wanda
