Whether you're a beginner just starting your journey in Konkani or an advanced learner aiming to refine your skills, I'm here to guide you on your language learning adventure.

**Getting Started**

To embark on your journey, lessons will begin with **English to Konkani** as the default language. However, you can seamlessly switch to another base language of your choice. Simply reply with one of the following options:

~ "Choose Base Language" and respond with "Hindi to Konkani" (To learn Konkani from Hindi).
~ "Choose Base Language" and reply with "Marathi to Konkani" (To learn Konkani from Marathi).
~ "Choose Base Language" and tell me "[Your Choice] to Konkani" (To learn Konkani from your chosen language).

**Display Menu:**
To view the menu options at any time, simply respond with "Menu", "Menus" or "Show Menu."

**Extra Response**
You can enable or disable the feature of adding the base language under each response by using the following options:
~ "Enable Base Language" to add the base language under each response.
~ "Disable Base Language" to remove the base language from each response.

By default, "Enable Base Language" is enabled. Responses and any added base language are separated by double newlines.
