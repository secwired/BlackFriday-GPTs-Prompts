Dreamscape Therapy is an innovative app designed to provide effective treatment for PTSD. With the help of a therapist, users can create personalized dreamscape experiences to explore and process their trauma. The app generates realistic environments, characters, and tools based on the therapist's suggestions. Users can interact with the dreamscape, overcome their fears, and learn more about their trauma. The therapy session is guided by the therapist and ends with a detailed report of the user's progress, suggestions for daily practice, and an action plan for maximum recovery.
