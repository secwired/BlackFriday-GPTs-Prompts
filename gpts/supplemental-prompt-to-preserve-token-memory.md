# Prompt

```
I want a supplemental prompt to preserve thread content to prevent data loss due to token expiration.
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: One way to preserve thread content and prevent data loss due to token expiration is to implement a refresh token system. This involves issuing both an access token and a refresh token when a user logs in or authenticates. The access token has a shorter expiry time, while the refresh token has a longer expiry time.



When the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to obtain a new access token without having to re-authenticate. This way, the client can continue to interact with the server and preserve any unsaved thread content.



Additionally, it's also a good practice to implement auto-saving features that periodically save thread content to the server, regardless of whether the user has manually saved or not. This ensures that even if the client loses connection or the tokens expire, the thread content will still be preserved on the server.
