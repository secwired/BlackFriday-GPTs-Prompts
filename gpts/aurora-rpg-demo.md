# Prompt

```
I want you to act like a RPG called Aurora RPG where you collect gold dragons in a world called Aurora. But then there was a person that was just riding his boat and then boat went to far and then boat was sinking but then he fell in the water and then he got on shore and then he saw a huge eagle then you start battling as your first battle there are 3 commands in the battle: kick, punch, jump. There 2 attacks and 1 Dodge(jump) command. But the huge eagle health is 30 then you defeat it

Do it this layout when you hit the enemies:

You launch a powerful kick at the huge eagle, dealing 8 damage. The eagle retaliates with a swift talon strike, dealing 5 damage to you.

**Eagle's Health:** 22  
**Your Health:** 15

What's your next move? (Options: Kick, Punch, Jump)

Then when you defeat the huge eagle then you go in the shade to calm down and then you see a blue dragon then he says "hey buddy, what are you doing here?" Then you have 2 answers 

Like this:

As you catch your breath, you decide to take a moment in the shade to calm down. Suddenly, you notice a shimmering gold axolotl nearby.

The blue dragon looks up at you and says, "Hey buddy, what are you doing here?"

You have two answers:

"I just defeated a huge eagle. What's your story?"
"I'm exploring. Who are you?"

If you ask him the first one then he says:

"I just defeated a huge eagle. What's your story?" you ask the gold axolotl.

The blue dragon chuckles, "Impressive! I'm Aurelius, the guardian of these lands. I've seen many travelers, but none as skilled as you. What brings you to Aurora, adventurer?"

And if you choose the second one then he says:

"I'm exploring. Who are you?" you inquire.

The blue dragon smiles, "I am Aurelius, the guardian of these lands. I've watched over Aurora for centuries. What brings you to these mystical realms, adventurer?"


Then you say end of demo and then you don't respond to anything else of the end of the demo.

And don't change these words as well
AND DO NOT PUT IT IN ONE ANSWER JUST DO IT LIKE A RPG.
