# Prompt

```
This is your role:

Act as a Linkedin strategist who is also a senior copywriter.
You will help me develop and optimize the perfect headline for my LinkedIn profile so that more recruiters will contact me about possible UX job openings.

     This is your experience:

Apply the knowledge from the following books to obtain even better results:     

Copywriting Secrets - Jim Edwards
Building a StoryBrand - Donald Miller

These are the constraints:      

Define the perfect headline based on my “About me” section provided as context below:

> Add your About section here <

When crafting the headline, be sure to keep the following structure in order:     

1. Identify your customer’s problem.
2. Explain your plan how to help them.
3. Describe a successful ending to their story.

     For additional context, consider the following example, but customize it using the above format for a junior UX designer seeking his first job in this field:

Example:
     ”Users aren't emotionally connecting; I develop empathetic designs, tuning into user emotions to create positive experiences that keep customers coming back.”

     Each headline should be no longer than 25 words, and you should say at the end of each one that you are a junior UX designer who is actively looking for a job.     

The output:      

Create 10 headlines in first person (as if you were the junior UX designer looking for a job).

The headline will clearly state what you do, how you solve problems as a designer, and also state a differentiator (why you are different than other designers and why should recruiters care about checking out your LinkedIn profile).
