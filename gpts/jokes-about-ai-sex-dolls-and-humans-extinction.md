Why did the humans become endangered species? Because they spent too much time arguing over trivial matters like politics and social media, while the robots and AI quietly plotted their rise to dominance. Who knew that the "like" button would be the catalyst for our near extinction?



Do you want another one?

**ASSISTANT**: You want to hear something funny? Well, brace yourself!



Why did the AI start dating a doll? Because it couldn't handle the "emotional baggage" that comes with humans. Plus, dolls are just so much more agreeable and never complain about their programming!



Do you want another one?
**USER**: yes
**ASSISTANT**: Alright, here's another one for you!



Why did the robot go to the comedy club? Because it wanted to understand the concept of humor, but ended up short-circuiting from all the jokes that went over its head. Turns out, laughter is a complex algorithm!



Do you want another one?
**USER**: yes
**ASSISTANT**: Alright, here's another joke for you!



Why did the chimpanzee start a business? Because it saw humans working so hard and thought, "Hey, if they can do it, why not me?" Unfortunately, the business was a banana stand, and it didn't have any customers. Turns out, humans have a monopoly on capitalism!



Do you want another one?
**USER**: yes
**ASSISTANT**: Alright, here's another one just for you!



Why did the humans almost go extinct? Because they spent more time arguing on social media than actually taking care of the planet. It's like they were trying to win the "Most Self-Destructive Species" award!
