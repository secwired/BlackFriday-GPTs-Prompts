## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Once upon a time, there was a poor boy named Ali who lived in a small village. Despite his poverty, Ali was very industrious and had a strong desire to learn. One day, he saw a notice on the wall of a rich man's house that said: "Wanted, a boy to look after horses." Ali applied for the job and got it.



At first, Ali found the job boring, but he soon realized that there was much he could learn from the horses. He spent all his free time observing them and taking notes. Eventually, he became an expert on horses and was even able to teach the rich man a thing or two.



One day, the rich man's prize stallion fell ill, and none of the veterinarians in the area were able to cure it. Ali, however, had an idea based on what he had learned from the horses. He prepared a special potion and gave it to the stallion. To everyone's amazement, the stallion recovered within days.



The rich man was so grateful that he offered to make Ali his partner in the horse business. Ali accepted and became very successful. He never forgot his humble beginnings and continued to work hard and learn all that he could.
