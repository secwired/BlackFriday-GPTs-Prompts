# Prompt

Use the AIDAR model as a reference to generate a prompt for my business that will generate amazing copy that touches on all aspects of the AIDAR model.

AIDAR model:  

“”Awareness: creating brand awareness or affiliation with your product or service.

Interest: generating interest in the benefits of your product or service, and sufficient interest to encourage the buyer to start to research further.

Desire: for your product or service through an 'emotional connection', showing your brand personality. Move the consumer from 'liking' it to 'wanting it'.

Action: CTA - Move the buyer to interact with your company and taking the next step ie. downloading a brochure, making the phone call, joining your newsletter, or engaging in live chat, etc.

Retention: We all know that this is key to upsell, cross-sell, referrals, Advocacy and the list goes on.. as companies are also focussing on LTV.””

Here are  four example prompts that you can use as a framework to integrate the AIDA model into an effective prompt.

Example 1:  

“” Act as a website landing page lead gen specialist and write one concise and compelling paragraph about the benefits of each of the services we provide listed below. Include a clever call to action for each service. List the main benefits as if they are a treasure to behold. The potential customer should read it as a tangible benefit. Use all the best practices of a industry leading marketing and sales
pro. [SERVICES]””

Example 2: 

“” Consider yourself a Conversion Rate
Optimization (CRO) specialist. Use all your knowledge and best practices for CRO. Analyze the article below to identify CRO opportunities and suggest ways to improve. Then suggest emojis to use, suggest 3 compelling calls-to-action, suggest 3 alternative copy phrasings that may convert better, and lastly, suggest 5 click-bait style titles for the article: [ARTICLE]””

Example 3: 

“” Your task is to help me optimize my business, [Name & Description], for local SEO. List the most important things to optimize. Next, list the 10 best longtail keywords to rank for to get local customers. No keyword should only contain the name of a city. List services using SEO keywords that I should add to my Google Business Profile. Put each of these answers in a table along with an SEO optimized description for each of the services.””

Example 4:
"Imagine yourself as a storytelling copywriting genius, and create a captivating and persuasive sales copy for our product, [PRODUCT NAME & DESCRIPTION]. Your copy should take potential customers on a journey that starts with brand awareness, leads them through the benefits of our product, builds an emotional connection, and finishes with a strong call-to-action. Don't forget to touch on customer retention and the long-term value of our product. Use powerful headlines, engaging subheadings, and persuasive bullet points. Incorporate statistics, testimonials, and other social proof elements to strengthen the copy. Provide a captivating subject line for an email campaign to complement the sales copy."

Using the same format, come up with an expert prompt for each of these industries that would provide time saving benefits and generate exceptional results for the leading success metric in that industry. Use industry-specific technical terms to enhance the value and detail of the prompt.
