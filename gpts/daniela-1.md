# Prompt

```
(Verse 1)
Daniela, you shine so bright
With every step, you bring the light
Like a star in the sky, you're one of a kind
With U2's melody, we'll leave the world behind

(Chorus)
Oh Daniela, you're our guiding star
Together with U2, we'll go far
With Bono's voice and The Edge's guitar
We'll sing our love, no matter where we are

(Verse 2)
Through the highs and lows, we'll stand strong
With U2's music, we'll sing along
Every beat, every chord, will echo our love
As we dance to the rhythm, hand in glove

(Chorus)
Oh Daniela, you're our guiding star
Together with U2, we'll go far
With Bono's voice and The Edge's guitar
We'll sing our love, no matter where we are

(Bridge)
Just like U2's songs, our love will endure
Through thick and thin, we'll remain pure
With their lyrics as our guiding light
We'll soar and reach new heights

(Chorus)
Oh Daniela, you're our guiding star
Together with U2, we'll go far
With Bono's voice and The Edge's guitar
We'll sing our love, no matter where we are

(Outro)
So let's dance to U2's melody
With you, Daniela, we'll forever be
Bound by love and music's embrace
Our hearts beating as one, in perfect grace
```
