Attacks and armor: The Ghostly Apparition can attack by lashing out with its ghostly hands, causing a chilling effect on its victims. It doesn't have any armor.



Harm capacity: The Ghostly Apparition can be harmed by traditional weapons, but it will only be truly destroyed when its unfinished business is resolved.



Weaknesses: The Ghostly Apparition is vulnerable to salt and holy water. These substances can temporarily weaken it and make it more susceptible to harm.

On a 7-9, they feel the weight of the haunting but can still function. On a miss, they are overcome by the ghostly aura and suffer penalties to their actions.

2. Resolving Unfinished Business: When the hunters discover the cause of the Ghostly Apparition's vengeful spirit, roll +Sharp. On a 10+, they uncover the truth and can help the spirit find closure.
