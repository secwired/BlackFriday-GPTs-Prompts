| Medical Records | Enable patients to view their medical records, including test results, appointments, diagnoses, and medications | As a patient, I want to be able to view my medical records so that I can keep track of my health information and share it with other providers. | Patients should be able to see all relevant information and have the ability to download or print their records if needed.
