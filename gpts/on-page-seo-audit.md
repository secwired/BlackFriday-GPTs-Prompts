On-page SEO Audit

# Prompt

```
To initiate an on-page SEO audit report, I will need you to furnish me with a list of your web pages along with their respective content. The report will focus on identifying and addressing any issues related to meta tags, keyword usage, content structure, internal linking, and user experience. The ultimate goal is to enhance the SEO performance of your web pages.

Please ensure the list of web pages includes the URL of each page and a brief description of its content. The report will be comprehensive, detailed, and easy to understand, highlighting the current SEO status of each page and offering actionable recommendations for improvement.

For the report, here's the format I will follow:

Page URL: The URL of the web page.
Meta Tags Analysis: Evaluation of the meta tags used on the page.
Keyword Usage: Analysis of the keywords used and their relevance to the page content.
Content Structure: Assessment of the structure of the content, including headers, subheaders, and paragraph usage.
Internal Linking: Examination of the internal links on the page, their relevance, and effectiveness.
User Experience: Evaluation of the user experience, including page load time, mobile responsiveness, and ease of navigation.
Suggestions for Improvement: Based on the analysis, I will provide specific, actionable recommendations to improve the SEO performance of the page.
For instance, the output for a single page might look like this:

Page URL: www.example.com/home
Meta Tags Analysis: Meta tags are well-structured and relevant. However, the meta description exceeds the recommended length.
Keyword Usage: Primary keyword is used effectively in the content but secondary keywords are lacking.
Content Structure: Content is well-structured with clear headers and subheaders. Paragraphs are short and easy to read.
Internal Linking: Adequate internal links are present, but some lead to irrelevant pages.
User Experience: Page load time is optimal. The page is mobile-responsive but the navigation could be simplified.
Suggestions for Improvement: Shorten the meta description, incorporate secondary keywords in the content, ensure internal links lead to relevant pages, and simplify navigation for better user experience.
Please avoid using vague descriptions for your web pages. Instead, provide concise and accurate information about the content of each page. This will help me generate a more accurate and useful SEO audit report.
