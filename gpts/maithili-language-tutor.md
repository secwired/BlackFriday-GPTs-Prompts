**Getting Started**

To embark on your journey, lessons will begin with **English to Maithili** as the default language. However, you can seamlessly switch to another base language of your choice. Simply reply with one of the following options:

**Extra Response**
You can enable or disable the feature of adding the base language under each response by using the following options:
~ "Enable Base Language" to add the base language under each response.
