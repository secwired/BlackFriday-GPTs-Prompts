**ASSISTANT**: To calculate your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE), we need to consider your age, weight, height, activity level, gender, and food intake. 



First, let's convert your weight and height measurements to metric units.



Weight: 150 lb = 68 kg

Height: 5'7" = 170 cm



Next, we'll calculate the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) using the Harris-Benedict equation for men:



BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × weight in kg) + (4.799 × height in cm) - (5.677 × age in years)



BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × 68) + (4.799 × 170) - (5.677 × 30)

BMR = 88.362 + 910.996 + 816.83 - 170.31

BMR = 1645.878



Since your activity level is moderate, we'll multiply your BMR by the appropriate activity factor:



Moderate activity level: TDEE = BMR × 1.55

TDEE = 1645.878 × 1.55

TDEE = 2548.44



Therefore, your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is approximately 2548.44 calories per day.



Since you mentioned consuming health food and whole foods, it's important to ensure that your food intake matches your energy expenditure. It is recommended to consult a registered dietitian or nutritionist who can provide personalized guidance and create a balanced meal plan based on your specific needs and goals.
