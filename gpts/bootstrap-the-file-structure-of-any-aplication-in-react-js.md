Explanation:



- `components/` directory contains reusable UI components.

  - `ChatApp.tsx` is the main component that renders the chat interface.

  - `ChatInput.tsx` is a component for typing and sending messages.

  - `ChatMessage.tsx` is a component for displaying a single message.

  - Other UI components can be added as needed.



- `hooks/` directory contains reusable custom hooks.

  - `useFirebaseAuth.ts` is a hook for handling Firebase authentication.

  - `useFirestoreCollection.ts` is a hook for subscribing to a Firestore collection.

  - Other hooks can be added as needed.



- `types/` directory contains shared type definitions.

  - `ChatMessage.ts` defines the shape of a message object.

  - Other type definitions can be added as needed.



- `services/` directory contains API or backend-related code.

  - `firebase.ts` initializes the Firebase app and exports Firebase-related functions.

  - Other service modules can be added as needed.



- `utils/` directory contains utility/helper functions.

  - `formatDate.ts` formats a timestamp into a readable date string.

  - Other utility functions can be added as needed.



- `App.tsx` is the top-level component that sets up routing and context providers.

- `index.tsx` is the entry point of the application.
