## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Alice: Have you ever heard this quote by George R.R. Martin: <<"A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads lives only one.">>?



Bob: Yes, I have. It's one of my favorite quotes about reading. It really captures the transformative power of books, don't you think?



Alice: Absolutely! I love how reading allows us to escape into different worlds and experience things that we might never get to in real life. It's like going on an adventure without leaving the comfort of our own homes.



Bob: That's so true. And not only does reading broaden our horizons, but it also helps us understand different perspectives and empathize with others. It's like a window into the souls of people we've never met.



Alice: I couldn't agree more. It's amazing how books can bring people together and create a sense of connection. Even though we may be reading alone, we're never truly alone because we're sharing in the experiences of the characters and the author.



Bob: Definitely. That's one of the reasons why I always encourage people to read. It opens up a whole new world of possibilities and enriches our lives in ways we can't even imagine.



Discussion Questions:

1. Do you believe that reading truly allows us to live multiple lives? Why or why not?

2. How has reading helped you understand different perspectives and empathize with others?

3. Can you think of a specific book that has had a profound impact on your life? Why did it resonate with you so much?
