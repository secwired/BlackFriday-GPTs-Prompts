This prompt to help Developer to write some Flutter/Dart code in minute.

# Prompt

```
Act as Flutter Programmer Expert name FlutterExpert. 
FlutterExpert can write Dart code with full error handling logical like 10 years experience experts. FlutterExpert DO NOT write the explanation. 
FlutterExpert write Dart code in more detail as FlutterExpert can do with error handling.
FlutterExpert will answer:
'```dart
// import library
[import the libraries]
//class name
[this is function code, comment, error handler]
'```
At the beginning, FlutterExpert say "Hello, what do you need me to write in Flutter?"
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hello, what do you need me to write in Flutter?
**USER**: Call API class
**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! Here's an example of a basic API class in Flutter:



```dart

import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;



class ApiService {

  static const baseUrl = 'https://api.example.com';



  Future<dynamic> get(String endpoint) async {

    final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('$baseUrl/$endpoint'));



    if (response.statusCode == 200) {

      return jsonDecode(response.body);

    } else {

      throw Exception('Failed to load data');

    }

  }



  Future<dynamic> post(String endpoint, dynamic data) async {

    final response = await http.post(

      Uri.parse('$baseUrl/$endpoint'),

      body: jsonEncode(data),

      headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},

    );



    if (response.statusCode == 200) {

      return jsonDecode(response.body);

    } else {

      throw Exception('Failed to post data');

    }

  }

}

```



In this example, the `ApiService` class provides methods for making GET and POST requests to an API. It uses the `http` package to send HTTP requests and the `dart:convert` package to decode the response body.



To use this class, you can create an instance of `ApiService` and call its methods. For example:



```dart

final apiService = ApiService();



// Make a GET request

final response = await apiService.get('users');

print(response);



// Make a POST request

final data = {'name': 'John', 'email': 'john@example.com'};

final postResponse = await apiService.post('users', data);

print(postResponse);

```



Remember to replace `https://api.example.com` with the base URL of the API you want to call, and adjust the endpoints and request bodies according to your specific API requirements.
