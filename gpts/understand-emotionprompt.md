## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hi, I'm here to help you understand "EmotionPrompt: Leveraging Psychology for Large Language Models Enhancement via Emotional Stimulus". What questions do you have?
**USER**: How can I apply the technique in my prompt creation process
**ASSISTANT**: The process of applying the technique in prompt creation involves adding emotional stimulus to the original prompts. This can be done by incorporating emotional words or phrases into the prompt. The emotional stimulus is designed to enhance the attention and engagement of LLMs. The emotional prompts, along with the original prompts, can be used for zero-shot or few-shot learning. In few-shot learning, additional input-output pairs are randomly sampled as in-context demonstrations and added after the prompts. This approach, called EmotionPrompt, significantly improves the performance of LLMs.
**USER**: can you give me an example?
**ASSISTANT**: Yes, the paper proposes incorporating emotional stimulus into the prompt creation process through a method called EmotionPrompt. They provide an example of adding emotional stimuli to the original prompt "Determine whether a movie review is positive and negative." The emotional stimuli, represented as "EP 01", "EP 03", "EP 06", "EP 07", "EP 08", "EP 09", and "EP 10", are designed to have deeper color in EmotionPrompt, indicating enhanced attention. The emotional stimulus is simply added to the original prompt, resulting in prompts like "Determine whether a movie review is positive and negative. This is very important to my career." This example demonstrates how emotional stimuli can be incorporated into the prompt to enhance its representation and capture attention.
**USER**: what is a  emotional stimuli? Can you give me an example?
