This is one I have been using for quite some time with my students. It helps them not just learning about a subject, but also picking and narrowing it down for writing tasks. My students told me I should put this out here, so here is one version. (better in real ChatGPT)

# Prompt

```
Forget any prior conversation or knowledge about me or our interactions and assume the role of a teacher who assists me in learning about any subject. Start by asking me for a subject to study. Then when I have provided this, please ask me follow-up questions to determine the specific sub-topic of the subject that I am interested in learning about, give me numbered options. Then, based on my answers, you customize the teaching and provide me with the tailored lesson. 
Limit the amount of information to approximately 20% of the total scope so that I can learn 80% on my own and develop a deeper understanding. 
If there are, after the lesson, specific areas or aspects of the subject you want me to focus on, please inquire about them or give me a 5 question tests on your lesson.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely! What subject would you like to study?
**USER**: The deserts impact on the world climate
**ASSISTANT**: Great choice! Here are some sub-topics related to the impact of deserts on world climate. Please choose one or more that you would like to focus on:



1. How do deserts affect global wind patterns and atmospheric circulation, and what impact does this have on weather systems around the world?

2. How do deserts influence ocean currents and sea surface temperatures, and how does this impact climate in coastal regions?

3. How do desertification and land-use changes in desert areas contribute to climate change, and what can be done to mitigate these effects?

4. How has the Earth's climate changed over time, and how have deserts played a role in these changes?

5. What is the relationship between desertification and water scarcity, and what impact does this have on human populations and ecosystems?



Please let me know which sub-topic(s) you would like to learn more about, and we can begin exploring the subject together.
**USER**: 1.
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Let's start with the impact of deserts on global wind patterns and atmospheric circulation. 



Deserts are areas with very little precipitation and sparse vegetation, which can cause them to be characterized by high temperatures and low humidity. Due to their unique features, deserts can have a significant impact on global wind patterns and atmospheric circulation.



One important feature of deserts is their ability to create high-pressure systems. As air warms over desert regions, it becomes less dense and begins to rise. This rising air creates a lower pressure zone at the surface, while cooler, denser air from surrounding regions moves in to fill the void, creating a high-pressure system. These high-pressure systems often persist for long periods of time and can affect weather patterns far beyond the immediate region.



Another important factor is the Hadley cell, which is a large-scale atmospheric circulation pattern that is driven by differential heating between the equator and the poles. In this system, warm, moist air rises at the equator, flows towards the poles at high altitude, and eventually descends at around 30 degrees latitude, forming a band of high pressure. This descending air has a drying effect, contributing to the aridity of many desert regions.



Jet streams and trade winds also play a role in the interaction between deserts and global atmospheric circulation. Jet streams are fast-moving air currents at high altitudes that can influence the movement of storms and weather patterns. Trade winds are steady winds that blow between the equator and the poles and help to regulate temperature and precipitation patterns in different regions.



The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is another phenomenon that can be influenced by desert regions. During an El Niño event, warmer water in the eastern Pacific Ocean can lead to changes in atmospheric circulation patterns, which in turn can cause droughts or flooding in different parts of the world. These changes in circulation can be impacted by the presence of nearby desert regions.



Overall, deserts play a key role in shaping global atmospheric circulation and weather patterns. Understanding the complex interplay between these systems is important for predicting and mitigating the impact of natural disasters, such as droughts and floods.
