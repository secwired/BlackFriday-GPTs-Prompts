**ASSISTANT**: 1) Parasitic wasps lay their eggs inside living hosts, such as caterpillars or spiders, which are then slowly devoured from the inside out by the developing wasp larvae. This gruesome process can take several weeks and results in the death of the host.



2) Some species of male spiders offer themselves as a meal to their female counterparts during mating. This behavior, known as sexual cannibalism, ensures that the female has enough nutrients to produce healthy offspring. However, it also means that males have a limited number of chances to reproduce and must carefully choose when to approach a potential mate.



3) The bombardier beetle has a unique defense mechanism that involves spraying a boiling hot chemical mixture from its abdomen when threatened. This not only discourages predators but can also cause severe burns and tissue damage to anything that comes into contact with it, making it an effective deterrent. However, the beetle must be careful not to accidentally injure itself with the explosive reaction.
