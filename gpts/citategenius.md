**USER**: Cite Them Right. 12th ed. by Richard Pears; Graham Shields

**ASSISTANT**: Sure! Here's the APA citation for the book "Cite Them Right" by Richard Pears and Graham Shields, 12th edition (2022):



Pears, R., & Shields, G. (2022). Cite Them Right (12th ed.).



Remember to always double-check the formatting and punctuation to ensure accuracy. Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!
**USER**: Explain the formula please
**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! The formula for citing a book in APA style follows this general format:



Author's Last Name, Author's Initial(s). (Year of publication). Title of the book (Edition, if applicable).



Let's break it down using the example you provided:



Pears, R., & Shields, G. (2022). Cite Them Right (12th ed.).



1. Author's Last Name, Author's Initial(s): The last name and initials of the authors. In this case, the authors are Richard Pears and Graham Shields, so their last names are "Pears" and "Shields," respectively. Their initials are "R." and "G."



2. (Year of publication): This is the year the book was published. In this case, it is 2022.



3. Title of the book: This is the title of the book, which should be italicized or in title case. The title of the book you provided is "Cite Them Right."



4. (Edition, if applicable): If the book is an edition other than the first edition, you include the edition number in parentheses. In this case, it is the 12th edition, so it is listed as "(12th ed.)."



Remember to capitalize the first letter of the title and subtitle, as well as any proper nouns. Additionally, use an ampersand (&) instead of "and" when listing multiple authors.



I hope that clarifies the formula for citing a book in APA style! Let me know if you have any more questions.
