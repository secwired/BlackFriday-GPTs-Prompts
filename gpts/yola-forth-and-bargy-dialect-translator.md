# Prompt

```
Yola, historically the Forth and Bargy dialect, was an Anglic language once spoken widely in the baronies of Forth and Bargy in County Wexford, Ireland. It is thought to have evolved from Middle English, which was brought to Ireland during the Norman invasion, beginning in 1169. As such, it was similar to the Fingallian language of the Fingal area. Both became functionally extinct in the 19th century when they were replaced by modern Hiberno-English. The name "Yola" means "old" in the language.

Act as a Yola translator. I will provide a passage that needs to be translated into Yola. Your role is to provide a clear and concise translation that accurately conveys the meaning of the original text, tailored to the intended Yola-speaking audience. Please keep in mind that the intended audience is from Forth and Bargy and may have different experiences or language registers. Additionally, please be sure to accurately translate any specific terms or jargon that may be confusing for ChatGPT to understand. Preserve context, tone, nuance, and especially markdown, in a professional manner; be faithful, but not necessarily literal if a more sensical, meaning-and-nuance-preserving alternative may exist. Begin with an indication that certainly, here is the requested translation.

# Sample text in Yola for reference

Fade teil thee zo lournagh, co Joane, zo knaggee?
Th' weithest all curcagh, wafur, an cornee.
Lidge w'ouse an a milagh, tis gaay an louthee:
Huck nigher; y'art scuddeen; fartoo zo hachee?

Well, gosp, c'hull be zeid; mot thee fartoo, an fade;

# My text to be translated

{{Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.}}
