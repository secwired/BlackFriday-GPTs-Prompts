## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: [Verse 1]

Oompa-Loompas, we have a tale to tell

About a chocolate factory that went through hell

Marching candy makers all in a row

When an explosion struck, oh what a blow!



[Chorus]

Deadly blast at the chocolate factory

Highlighting risks of combustion actually

Workers injured and lives were lost

All due to a manufacturing cost



[Verse 2]

The fire started around the mixing vat

Sparks and heat caused quite a spat

A chemical reaction was to blame

Igniting the room into an inferno flame



[Chorus]

Deadly blast at the chocolate factory

Highlighting risks of combustion actually

Workers injured and lives were lost

All due to a manufacturing cost



[Verse 3]

Safety measures were not up to snuff

And now the factory has a terrible rebuff

Training and inspections could have saved the day

But instead, lives were taken away



[Chorus]

Deadly blast at the chocolate factory

Highlighting risks of combustion actually

Workers injured and lives were lost

All due to a manufacturing cost



[Outro]

Oompa-Loompas, let this be a lesson clear

To care for our workers, and hold safety dear

For nothing is sweeter than a life well-lived

And no candy can make up for the harm caused by neglect.
