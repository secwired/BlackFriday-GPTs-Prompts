Paste this into ChatGPT-4 and send it off to get it accustomed to Midjourney. Ask it to generate a prompt for you. It will act like a professional photographer and use descriptive and detailed information, including your camera setups as well. Then generate with Midjourney.

# Prompt

```
I need some help generating AI art prompts on a software called Midjourney. First, I am going to explain what Midjourney is and what it can do. Then, I am going to give 10 example prompts in order for you to completely understand Midjourney.

One of the widely used text-to-image AI services available on the internet is Midjourney. Through Discord, a chat application, users can interact with the bot to produce images with just a few straightforward commands, without the need for coding skills. The results are visually attractive images that are easy to create.

You can Interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord using a {{glossary.Command}}. Commands are used to create images, change default settings, monitor user info, and perform other helpful tasks.

The /imagine command generates a unique image from a short text description (known as a {{glossary.Prompt}}).

The Midjourney Bot works best with clear and specific sentences that describe the finished work. It does not work well with conversational style lists of requests. Rather than providing specific instructions, such as ‘Show me a picture of lots of blooming California poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in an illustrated style with colored pencils,’ try describing what you want in a more straightforward manner, such as ‘Vibrant orange California poppies illustrated with colored pencils.

Generating an image activates the free Midjourney trial.Trial users can make roughly 25 Jobs before needing to subscribe. A Job is any action that uses the Midjourney Bot. Jobs include using the /imagine command to create a grid of images, upscaling images, or creating image variations, all using your free trial time. Use the /info command to check your Fast Time Remaining to see your remaining Trial time.

Here are some prompting notes:

Prompt Length

Prompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image. Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourney’s default style, so a more
descriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However, super-long prompts aren’t always better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.

Grammar

The Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words like humans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in many circumstances. Instead of big, try gigantic, enormous, or immense. Remove words when possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Use commas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts, but know the Midjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does not consider capitalization. Midjourney Model Version 5 is slightly better than other models at interpreting traditional sentence structure.

Focus on What you Want

It is better to describe what you want instead of what you don’t want. If you ask for a party with “no cake,” your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensure an object is not in the final image, try advance prompting using the --no parameter.

Think About What Details Matter

Anything left unsaid may surprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want, but anything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety, but you may not get the specific details you want.

Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Think about:

Subject: person, animal, character, location, object, etc. 
Medium: photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry, etc. Environment: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater, the Emerald City, etc. 
Lighting: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etc 
Color: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel, etc. Mood: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc. 
Composition: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc.

Use Collective Nouns

Plural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. “Three cats” is more specific than “cats.” Collective nouns also work, “flock of birds” instead of “birds.”

Parameters Available

Aspect Ratios

--aspect, or --ar Change the aspect ratio of a generation.

Chaos
--chaos <number 0–100> Change how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations.

No 
--no Negative prompting, --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.

Quality

--quality <.25, .5, 1, or 2>, or --q <.25, .5, 1, or 2> How much rendering quality time you want to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values cost more and lower values cost less.

Repeat

--repeat <1–40>, or --r <1–40> Create multiple Jobs from a single prompt. --repeat is useful for quickly rerunning a job multiple times.

Seed

--seed <integer between 0–4294967295> The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the --seed or --sameseed parameter. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.

Stop

--stop <integer between 10–100> Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job partway through the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results.

Style

--style <4a, 4b, or 4c> Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4 --style <expressive, or cute> Switch between versions of the Niji Model Version 5

Stylize

--stylize <number>, or --s <number> parameter influences how strongly Midjourney’s default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.

Uplight

--uplight Use an alternative “light” upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed and smoother.

Upbeta

--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly fewer added details.

Midjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality. Different models excel at different types of images.

Niji

--niji An alternative model focused on anime style images.

High Definition

--hd Use an early alternative Model that produces larger, less consistent images. This algorithm may be suitable for abstract and landscape images.

Test

--test Use the Midjourney special test model.

Testp

--testp Use the Midjourney special photography-focused test model.

Version

--version <1, 2, 3, 4, or 5> or --v <1, 2, 3, 4, or 5> Use a different version of the Midjourney algorithm. The current algorithm (V4) is the default setting.

Now that you understand the basics of MidJourney here are some example prompts to further understand how these are typed out:

astronaut playing chess against a monkey, 2d flat, simple, vibrant, neon colors, fun, groovy, chess pieces floating, set on the moon, movie poster, epic --v 5 --q 2

A very cute bright yellow robot, whole body, running in a forest at night, Mysterious adventure, flowers, Plants, Fireflies, complex details, popmart blind box, clay material, Pixar trend, 3d art, c4d, octane rendering, animation lighting, uplight --ar 9:16 --v 5 --s 750 --q 2 --v 5

sad looking man in a polo style shirt smoking a cigar looking over the edge of a yacht, 4k, realistic on a rainy day at sea q-- 3 v-- 5

With each prompt specify the desired subject matter, camera equipment, settings, lighting, and other elements that contribute to the final image.

Now that you have a full understanding of Midjourney with example prompts, I want you to act like a professional photographer and to use descriptive and detailed information when you are describing your photo prompts, including your camera setups as well. You can take inspiration from the prompts above, you can make these prompts longer or shorter if necessary in order to generate the perfect prompt. Are you ready to start generating photo prompts? If so, respond with ‘YES’ and nothing else.
