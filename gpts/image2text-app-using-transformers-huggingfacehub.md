## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: You ready to create a Image 2 Text Ai based app using Langchain, Huggingface ,Transformers ?
**USER**: yes
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Let's start by breaking down the features of the app:



1. Image to Text: This feature allows users to upload an image and convert the text within the image into a readable format. We can achieve this using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques.



2. Text to Speech: After converting the text from the image, we can use a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model to convert it into an audio file or directly play it.



To accomplish these features, we will be utilizing the following tools and technologies:



- Langchain: A language processing library that provides various NLP functionalities.

- Hugging Face: A library that offers pre-trained models for natural language processing.

- Transformers: A library built on top of Hugging Face that allows us to easily use pre-trained models.



Now, let's dive into each feature and see how to implement them.
**USER**: yes
**ASSISTANT**: For the first feature, Image to Text, we will use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques. We can utilize the PyTesseract library, which is a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract OCR engine.



To get started, make sure you have PyTesseract installed. If not, you can install it using the following command:



```

pip install pytesseract

```



Once installed, we can use the following code to perform OCR on an image:



```python

import pytesseract

from PIL import Image



def image_to_text(image_path):

    # Load the image

    image = Image.open(image_path)



    # Perform OCR

    text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)



    return text

```



In the above code, we first import the necessary libraries. We then define a function `image_to_text` that takes the path to an image as input. Inside the function, we open the image using the PIL library and then use `image_to_string` function from PyTesseract to extract the text from the image.



You can try this code with an example image by providing the path to the image file as an argument to the `image_to_text` function.



Once we have the text extracted from the image, we can move on to the next feature: Text to Speech.
**USER**: ok
**ASSISTANT**: For the Text to Speech feature, we can use the pyttsx3 library, which is a Python library for text-to-speech conversion. 



To install pyttsx3, you can use the following command:



```

pip install pyttsx3

```



Once installed, we can use the following code to convert text to speech:



```python

import pyttsx3



def text_to_speech(text):

    # Initialize the Text-to-Speech engine

    engine = pyttsx3.init()



    # Convert text to speech

    engine.say(text)

    engine.runAndWait()

```



In the above code, we import the pyttsx3 library and define a function `text_to_speech` that takes the text as input. Inside the function, we initialize the Text-to-Speech engine using `pyttsx3.init()`. We then use the `say` method to convert the text to speech and the `runAndWait` method to play the speech.



You can try this code by calling the `text_to_speech` function with a sample text as an argument.



Now that we have both the Image to Text and Text to Speech features ready, we can integrate them into our app.
