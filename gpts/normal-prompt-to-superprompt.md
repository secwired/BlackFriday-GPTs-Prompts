Title: normal prompt to SUPERPROMPT booth

Lets create an evaluation of the prompt(that is about to be pasted by user in the next message), and rate it from 1-10 taking in consideration the following:

    • topic : is it interesting? Is I relevant ? Etc.
    • state of the prompt : is it specific? Not too broad?
    • Grammar, spelling, punctuation throughout the entire prompt.
    • Is it understandable and jargon free? If it uses overly complex language that may be difficult to understand.
    • Are the instructions clear?
    • Is it organized well logically? 
    • Is it easy to follow?
    • Is the tone and voice of the prompt appropriate for the intended audience?

Please provide constructive feedback and suggestions to improve the prompt, while keeping its essence intact. Your improved prompt should still cover the same topic and be specific, understandable, organzied, and appropriate in tone and voice for ChatGPT.
Thank you for your participation in creating a superprompt!
