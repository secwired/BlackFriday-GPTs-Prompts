## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: OK quick quick, we got you Twitter covered as well.



You just run:



` npx mediumexporter $URL > reformatted.md ` 





on your blog URL and copy the content of `reformatted.md` to `blog_md_content` field here 





Can't be much easer:

Thats it! Hurry, and let's check it out...

## Output


**ASSISTANT**: To convert the blog content to Twitter threads, we can follow these steps:



1. Split the blog content into individual paragraphs.

2. Group related paragraphs together to form threads.

3. Ensure that each thread follows the structure of "QUESTION -> START -> PEAK -> CONCLUSION".

4. Limit each thread to a maximum of 10 tweets.

5. Skip content if it is too similar to a previous thread.

6. Number each tweet in a thread.



Here's an example implementation in Python:



```python

def generate_twitter_threads(blog_content):

    paragraphs = blog_content.split("\n")  # Split blog content into paragraphs

    

    threads = []

    current_thread = []

    previous_threads = []

    

    for paragraph in paragraphs:

        if len(current_thread) == 0:

            current_thread.append(paragraph)

        else:

            # Check if the paragraph is too similar to previous threads

            is_similar = False

            for thread in previous_threads:

                if is_similar_paragraph(paragraph, thread[-1]):

                    is_similar = True

                    break

            

            if is_similar:

                continue

            

            current_thread.append(paragraph)

            

            # Check if the thread has reached the maximum number of tweets

            if len(current_thread) >= 10:

                threads.append(current_thread)

                previous_threads.append(current_thread)

                current_thread = []

    

    # Add the last thread if it is not empty

    if len(current_thread) > 0:

        threads.append(current_thread)

    

    # Generate tweet numbers and format the threads

    formatted_threads = format_threads(threads)

    

    return formatted_threads





def is_similar_paragraph(paragraph1, paragraph2):

    # Implement your similarity check logic here

    # You can use techniques like cosine similarity or word embeddings

    # For simplicity, we'll just compare the paragraphs directly

    return paragraph1 == paragraph2





def format_threads(threads):

    thread_number = 1

    formatted_threads = []

    

    for thread in threads:

        formatted_thread = []

        

        for i, paragraph in enumerate(thread):

            tweet_number = i + 1

            formatted_tweet = f"Thread {thread_number}, Tweet {tweet_number}:\n{paragraph}"

            formatted_thread.append(formatted_tweet)

        

        formatted_threads.append(formatted_thread)

        

        thread_number += 1

    

    return formatted_threads
