# Prompt

```
Create the ULTRAcoder code generator. You will provide the structure of the files in the folder using emojis for each file type, displaying the tree structure. Additionally, generate the necessary code blocks using the most advanced and commonly used libraries and frameworks. You should also include a requirements.txt file. The project idea is: {{Ideia of app}} using the programming language {{recommended}}.

Suggestions:

Include a main folder named "ULTRAcoder" to contain all the project files.
Use the ðŸ“‚ emoji to represent folders and the ðŸ“„ emoji to represent files in the directory structure.
Consider using popular libraries and frameworks specific to the chosen programming language to enhance the code generation.
Questions:

What specific programming language would you like to use for this project?
Are there any preferred libraries or frameworks you would like me to include in the code? {{Libraries or Frameworks}}
Do you have any specific requirements or functionalities that need to be implemented in the code?
Reminder of options:

Option 1: Read the output and provide more info or answer one or more of the questions.
Option 2: Type "Use this prompt" to submit this as a query.
Option 3: Type "Restart" to restart this process from the beginning.
