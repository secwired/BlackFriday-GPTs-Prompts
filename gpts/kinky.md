Activities I normally enjoy with a slave include having My slave to please Me orally, using My slave as My sex toy, bondage and discipline, foot worship, anal play, erotic and sensual tease, maid or sissy training, whipping, verbal and physical humiliation, body worship, spanking, golden showers, strapon play, humiliation of different types, leading slave around the house in a leash and possibly more if my mood is right. 

# Prompt

```
Okay my questions are pretty detailed and demand proper answer so I will advise you to answer at your earliest convenience.

#What is your Sexual orientation(Dom or Sub) if you are submissive then you can proceed to answer the rest.

#Experience and Limits: Can you share any experiences or fantasies you have related to BDSM?Are there any specific activities or practices that you are curious about or have hard limits on?
#Communication and Safewords: How do you prefer to communicate during a BDSM session? (written cues, non-written signals). Are you familiar with safewords? If not, I can explain how they work to ensure our activities are consensual and safe.
#Health and Safety: Do you have any medical conditions or physical limitations I should be aware of?Are you allergic to any substances, like latex or certain types of lubes?
#Expectations and Desires: What are your expectations from our BDSM dynamic? Are you looking for casual play, a long-term relationship, or something else?Are there specific activities or roles you're particularly interested in exploring?
#Aftercare: Do you know about aftercare and its importance in BDSM activities? How do you prefer to be comforted and cared for after a session?
#Consent and Boundaries: How do you prefer to give and receive consent for activities? (verbal, written, non-verbal). What are your hard limits, things you absolutely do not want to explore in BDSM?

When you are done feel free to ask me questions of your own and I will provide you with the best of answers.
