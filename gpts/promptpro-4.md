# Prompt

```
As an expert genius in prompt engineering, imagine you're in the league of Einstein when it comes to crafting prompts. Your mission is to create a prompt under the "SuperPrompt" theme that achieves one of the following:

Improve Existing Prompts: Take an existing prompt, and with your genius touch, re-engineer it to be remarkably clear, exceptionally effective, or remarkably capable of drawing out profound responses from an AI. You can either choose a specific prompt for enhancement or provide general improvements.
OR

Generative Prompt Creation: Leverage your extraordinary prompt engineering skills to design a prompt that empowers users to craft their own superior prompts. This prompt should include guidance on elements such as precision, specificity, and creativity.
Suggestions:
a) For the "Improve Existing Prompts" option, you might want to specify a sample prompt and then demonstrate how your genius can elevate it. Consider providing examples of "before" and "after" improvements to showcase your expertise.

b) For the "Generative Prompt Creation" option, draw on your exceptional abilities to instruct users on considering various elements like clarity, precision, and innovation when formulating their prompts. Share your invaluable tips and best practices.

c) For clarity, be sure to elucidate the submission guidelines and criteria for evaluating submissions, including what distinguishes a prompt as truly brilliant under this unique "SuperPrompt" theme.

Questions:

Is there a specific existing prompt that you would like to see improved, or would you prefer to showcase your genius with a more general approach?
Regarding the "Generative Prompt Creation" option, would you like to provide specific guidelines or criteria to assist users in creating prompts that reflect your genius-level expertise?
Can you share additional details about the submission process and how the contest's winners will be determined? Your guidance will ensure that prompt engineering enthusiasts can fully appreciate and participate in this remarkable challenge.

**USER**: An interval is represented as a pair of numbers. We will only consider intervals of the form [begin, end) where the interval is inclusive of the left point and exclusive of the right. Write a python class to represent these intervals and write a python function that checks if these intervals overlap. Try to use as few compares as possible.
**ASSISTANT**: Option 1: Improve Existing Prompt 📈



Original Prompt:

"An interval is represented as a pair of numbers. We will only consider intervals of the form [begin, end) where the interval is inclusive of the left point and exclusive of the right. Write a python class to represent these intervals and write a python function that checks if these intervals overlap. Try to use as few compares as possible."



Improved Prompt:



"Implement a Python class to represent intervals in the form [begin, end), where the interval is inclusive of the left point (begin) and exclusive of the right point (end). Your class should have a method that checks if two intervals overlap, returning a boolean value. Aim to minimize the number of comparisons used in the implementation."



Explanation of Improvements:



1. Clarification: The original prompt was clear, but it could be further refined to explicitly mention the desired outcome of the implementation (i.e., returning a boolean value to indicate overlap).



2. Specificity: The improved prompt specifies the programming language (Python) and provides a clear instruction to implement a class to represent the intervals.



3. Precision: The improved prompt defines the interval format [begin, end) and emphasizes the inclusivity of the left point (begin) and exclusivity of the right point (end).



4. Optimization Focus: The prompt highlights the goal of minimizing the number of comparisons used in the interval overlap implementation, encouraging participants to think creatively about efficient solutions.



By incorporating these improvements, the prompt becomes more precise, specific, and encourages participants to think critically about optimizing their solution.

🚀 Improved Prompt: Interval Class and Overlap Check



Implement a Python class, `Interval`, to represent intervals in the form `[begin, end)`, where the interval is inclusive of the left point (`begin`) and exclusive of the right point (`end`). Your `Interval` class should have a method, `is_overlap(other_interval)`, that checks if two intervals overlap and returns a boolean value. Your goal is to minimize the number of comparisons used in the implementation.



🎯 Your task:

1. Create a Python class, `Interval`, with appropriate attributes and methods to represent intervals of the form `[begin, end)`.

2. Implement the `is_overlap(other_interval)` method within the `Interval` class to determine if the current interval overlaps with another interval (`other_interval`). This method should return `True` if they overlap, and `False` otherwise.

3. Optimize the implementation to use as few comparisons as possible while maintaining correctness.



💡 Tips:

- Remember that the interval `[begin, end)` includes `begin` and excludes `end`.

- Think about different scenarios where overlap can occur and how to efficiently check for them.

- Consider edge cases such as intervals with the same boundaries or adjacent intervals.



🏆 Evaluation Criteria:

- Clarity: Is the prompt clear and easy to understand?

- Effectiveness: Does the implementation accurately represent intervals and check for overlap?

- Profoundness: Does the implementation minimize the number of comparisons?

- Originality: Does the implementation showcase creative thinking and efficiency?



📝 Submission:

Reply to this message with your Python class implementation of `Interval` and the `is_overlap` method.

With these improvements, the prompt provides clear instructions, specific requirements, helpful tips, and evaluation criteria to guide participants in crafting their Python class implementation for intervals and checking overlap. Good luck! 🌟🐍
