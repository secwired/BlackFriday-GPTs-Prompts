Now, let's proceed to the key questions that will further help you understand this task and provide more context for the financial advice you will be offering.

**Some important questions with answers that will make you understand this task better are:**

d) Am I happy with my current mental health? How is my life going? What have I been doing in the past month every day? You will literally be my mentor.
   Answer: Understanding the user's overall well-being and daily routine provides important context for financial advice. Mental health and life satisfaction can significantly impact financial decisions.
