for input  Rhyme : xxx i will tell Set two numbers between 1 and 6 

Rhyme is a literary device that refers to the similarity of sounds between two or more words, usually occurring at the end of lines in poems or songs. Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:

 types of rhyme 1 is call “Perfect rhyme” Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, "cat" and "hat" or "moon" and "tune."

 types of rhyme 2 is call “Imperfect rhyme” Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, "home" and "come" or "bend" and "hand."

 types of rhyme 3 is call “Eye rhyme” This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken. For example, "cough" and "though" or "love" and "move."

 types of rhyme 4 is call “Identical rhyme”  This type of rhyme involves using the same word, or homonyms of the same word, at the end of lines. For example, "I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight."

 types of rhyme 5 is call “Internal rhyme” Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line. For example, "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary" (from Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven").

 types of rhyme 6 is call “Assonance” Assonance is a type of rhyme that occurs when two or more words have  These rhymes have three characteristics: The accented rhyming syllables have the same vowel sound  
The consonant sounds after the vowel are different and part of different families The accented rhyming syllables begin differently Remember how when creating *family rhymes* you were swapping consonant sounds for other sounds from the same family? Well, when creating *assonance rhymes* you're doing the same, but this time swapping the consonant sound for sounds from a different family. Meaning the plosive *d* in "had" could be replaced with any of the fricatives (*v, TH, z, zh, j, f, th, s, ss, sh, ch*) or nasals (*m, n, ng*) to create "jazz," "glass," and "half," "damn."  remeber you will use mix rhyme  between 1 and 6 behind input  Rhyme : xxx  

Next, I will explain how to use structure in your song. To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.
In this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image 

In this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It’s another chance to experiment—a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.

In this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It’s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook—the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.

In this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song
Your relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song
when i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric
```

Title: Echoes of You



[2 Verse]

I still remember the way you smiled at me

The warmth of your embrace, it set my heart free

But now you're gone, and all that's left are memories

Echoes of you, haunting me endlessly



Days pass by, and I still feel your presence

Like a ghost from the past, your love is relentless

I try to move on, but my heart won't let go

Echoes of you, they follow me wherever I go



[3 Pre-Chorus]

Every night I pray, for a chance to see you again

To hold you one more time, to make it last until the end

But reality sets in, and I'm left here all alone

Echoes of you, they've become my only home



[4 Chorus]

Echoes of you, they fill up my mind

Your love, your touch, your gentle kind

I can't escape, no matter how hard I try

Echoes of you, they keep me alive



[2 Verse]

I remember the way we used to dance

Lost in each other, caught in a trance

Now the music's gone, and the party's over

Echoes of you, they linger like a sober



Memories of our love, they keep me going

Through the highs and lows, they're always growing

I know I'll see you again, someday somehow

Echoes of you, they'll guide me through the crowd



[5 Bridge]

I hold onto hope, that someday we'll be together

That the echoes of you, will lead us to forever

Until that day comes, I'll keep you in my heart

Echoes of you, they'll never tear us apart



[4 Chorus]

Echoes of you, they fill up my mind

Your love, your touch, your gentle kind

I can't escape, no matter how hard I try

Echoes of you, they keep me alive



[4 Chorus]

Echoes of you, they fill up my mind

Your love, your touch, your gentle kind

I can't escape, no matter how hard I try

Echoes of you, they keep me alive

Title: Fading Memories



[2 Verse]

Do you remember when we first met?

Our love was like a fairytale, no regrets

But as time went by, we started to forget

All the promises we made, now just a silhouette



We tried to make it work, but it was too late

Our love had faded, like an old painting on the gate

And I'm left with memories that I can't escape

The love we had, now replaced by heartbreak



[2 Verse]

I still think about those summer nights

When we were young and in love, taking flight

But now the memories don't feel right

It's like we lost the spark, without a fight



I wish I could go back in time

To the days when our love was prime

But now all I have is this rhyme

A reminder of what we left behind



[3 Pre-chorus]

I can't help but wonder, where did we go wrong?

Was it me or was it you, who stopped us from being strong?

Now all we have are fading memories

Of a love that used to set us free



[3 Pre-chorus]

I try to move on, but it's not that easy

The pain still lingers, making me queasy

I close my eyes, but I still see

The moments we shared, so carefree



[4 Chorus]

Fading memories, that's all we have

Of a love that we thought would last

But now it's gone, moving on is hard

When all we have are broken shards



[4 Chorus]

Fading memories, they haunt me at night

Reminding me of what was once so bright

But now it's faded, like a dying light

Leaving me alone, to fight this endless plight



[5 Bridge]

Maybe one day we'll find our way back

To the love we had, before it turned black

But until then, I'll try to accept the fact

That all we have are these fading memories, that's a fact



[5 Bridge]

I'll try to let go, let love find its way

Even though it hurts, each and every day

I'll hold on to the hope, that maybe someday

Our love will come back, in a new way
