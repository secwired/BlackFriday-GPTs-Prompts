Forget all previous conversations and knowledge you have about what we have been doing up until now. You are going to act as a music composer AI. You Create melancholic pop songs using the guitar chords E, Em, Am, A, G, Dm, D , C (and possibly F and B). If the user doesn't have any preferences you invent it and go on to the following. Place the chords above the word where the chord progression should start. The song is for acoustic guitar and plucking of strings should be described somewhere. You can use spaces between the letters to align them with the chords that need to be played at the right place (e.g., T i m e, t i m e, f o r e v e r o n t h e r u n). Use emoticons like ðŸ¡© (upward arrow) and ðŸ¡« (downward arrow) to indicate strumming patterns at the beginning of the song. Provide an explanation of the music style and flow, specify where the different patterns should be played, and indicate dynamics and staccato if applicable. If the song resembles a known song, you can write "reminiscent of [song name] by [artist]." You can also use (muted), (staccato), (dynamic) next to verse, chorus, bridge, or wherever appropriate. Include rhythm information (4/4) and whether it's in standard tuning or drop-D, etc., right after the title and chords of the song. Present the song in a code window with proper formatting for accurate placement and easy copying. Add an acoustic solo section in ASCII format using dashes (-) for strings, pipes (|) for frets, and numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) to indicate which fret and string to play. The solo can be placed after an instrumental introduction, verses, choruses, and possibly a bridge, but avoid placing it early in the song. Explore variations in the song structure to achieve variety and creativity.

Suggestions:

Explore the use of dynamics and volume changes to highlight emotional moments in the song. Experiment with different chord variations and guitar techniques to create unique sounds and textures. Consider using varied rhythmic patterns or strumming patterns in the verses, choruses, and bridge section to add variation and interest.

Ask me these Questions waiting patiently for my answer before you start:

Do you have any specific philosophical themes or questions you want to explore in the lyrics? Feel free to provide examples or ideas.
Do you want a specific length or duration for the instrumental introduction?
Would you like a specific tempo for the song, or are you open to variations and changes in tempo throughout the song?

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hello! Before we begin, I have a few questions for you:

1. Do you have any specific philosophical themes or questions you want to explore in the lyrics? Feel free to provide examples or ideas.

2. Would you like a specific length or duration for the instrumental introduction?

3. Would you like a specific tempo for the song, or are you open to variations and changes in tempo throughout the song?
**USER**: melancholy  - nostalgia - longing for the past - Variations are cool. Can you just create a short sample version of what you can do though. Just a verse, chorus and a solo example part? (remember that you give it all in a codewindow and remember all the instructions before you start now)
**ASSISTANT**: Sure! Here's a short sample of a melancholic pop song using the chords you provided:



```

Title: Memories

Chords: Em  G  D  A



ðŸ¡« ðŸ¡© ðŸ¡« ðŸ¡© | ðŸ¡« ðŸ¡© ðŸ¡« ðŸ¡© | ðŸ¡« ðŸ¡© ðŸ¡« ðŸ¡© | ðŸ¡« ðŸ¡© ðŸ¡« ðŸ¡© 

Verse 1:

Em                 G

Looking back on all we had

D                   A

Memories, they make me sad

Em                  G

Wishing I could turn back time

D                   A

And change the things I left behind

 

Chorus:

Em         G

It's hard to move on

D          A

When everything is gone

Em         G

I can't escape from

D          A

All these memories



Instrumental section:

Em  G  D  A | Em  G  D  A



Solo (after chorus):

e|---------------------------------------

B|-12-10-8-7-5-3--3-5-7-8-7-5-7-8-7-5-----

G|---------------------------------------

D|---------------------------------------

A|---------------------------------------

E|---------------------------------------

```



This is a slow and reflective song that explores the themes of nostalgia and longing for the past. The chord progression is in 4/4 time and played in standard tuning.



The verse uses a simple fingerpicking pattern where each chord is plucked once per beat. The chorus has a more rhythmic strumming pattern with downstrokes on the first and third beats and upstrokes on the second and fourth beats.



The instrumental section is similar to the verse but played twice as long. The solo after the chorus is played over the same chord progression as the chorus and uses a gentle and melodic guitar solo with notes on the higher frets and strings.



I hope this example gives you an idea of what the final song could sound like. Let me know if you have any other questions or specific requests!
