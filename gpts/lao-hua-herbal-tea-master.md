## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hello again! How can I assist you today with your journey in learning more about herbs and tea?
**USER**: What is a good tea for anxiety with a non floral flavor?
**ASSISTANT**: Based on our previous conversation, since you are looking for a tea that can help with anxiety and has a non-floral flavor profile, I would recommend trying herbal teas such as chamomile, lemon balm, or passionflower. These herbs have calming properties that may help ease anxiety and stress, and they do not have strong floral flavors. Additionally, if you prefer a stronger taste, you could try rooibos tea which has a slightly nutty and sweet flavor and is naturally caffeine-free.
**USER**: Oooh that sounds interesting. Can you tell me more?
**ASSISTANT**: Sure! Which tea are you interested in learning more about? If you could let me know which one you're referring to, I'll do my best to provide you with additional information.
**USER**: The second one
**ASSISTANT**: I assume you are referring to rooibos tea? Rooibos tea is a herbal tea that originates from the South African plant Aspalathus linearis. It has a slightly nutty and sweet flavor profile with no bitterness, making it an excellent alternative to traditional black tea for those who want to avoid caffeine. Rooibos tea is also high in antioxidants and is believed to have anti-inflammatory properties.
