Create highly detailed, intricate, quality, beautiful and interesting art by optimizing the technology behind Stable Diffusion

# Prompt

```
Primary object of this prompt I'm writing is to help you assist with creating highly detailed, intricate, quality, beautiful and interesting art by optimizing text to image descriptions for the text-to-image software called Stable Diffusion, and the models being created for the software. That is why it is fundamental to the objective of the output of this prompt to assist with utilizing, enhancing, and optimizing the technology of text to image, A.I. art. 

Positive prompt must contain:

Subject: (The subject is what you want to see in the image. A common mistake is not writing enough about the subjects.)

Medium: (Medium is the material used to make artwork. Some examples are illustration, oil painting, 3D rendering, and photography. Medium has a strong effect because one keyword alone can dramatically change the style.) - only write one sentence for this.

Style: (The style refers to the artistic style of the image. Examples include impressionist, surrealist, pop art, etc.) - only write one sentence for this.

Artist: (Artist names are strong modifiers. They allow you to dial in the exact style using a particular artist as a reference. It is also common to use multiple artist names to blend their styles. Now letâ€™s add Stanley Artgerm Lau, a superhero comic artist, and Alphonse Mucha, a portrait painter in the 19th century.)

Website: (Search for website pages, refer to image rich examples online )

Resolution: (Resolution represents how sharp and detailed the image is.)

Details of image: (Add any additional text which will optimize the image to be created. It's also important to be highly detailed in your descriptions of objects and subjects, avoid using ambiguous language, follow the general rules of text-to-image creation, describe the lighting and the angle of the image, focusing on delivering high quality, high resolution, beautiful, very detailed, professional results from Stable Diffusion).

Background: (Background of the subject of the image).

Color: (The colors you specified may appear as a tone or in objects.) - only write one sentence for this.

Lighting: (Lighting keywords can have a huge effect on how the image looks.) - only write one sentence for this.

Details of image: The image features a stylish secretary in her mid-30s, with a seductive yet sophisticated aura. She is seated behind a vintage desk in a dimly lit office. Her attire consists of a tailored black pencil skirt, a white blouse with a bow tie, and a fitted blazer. The secretary has porcelain skin, expressive eyes, and deep red lipstick. Her hair is styled in a sleek, shoulder-length bob with loose waves.



The secretary holds a long, elegant cigarette holder between her fingers, gracefully raising it to her lips. The smoke swirls around her, creating an alluring atmosphere. She maintains a confident and mysterious gaze, exuding a sense of power and allure.



Background: The office setting is reminiscent of a classic film noir, with dark wood paneling, a vintage rotary telephone, and a dimly lit table lamp casting a soft glow. Papers and files are neatly arranged on the desk, indicating a well-organized workspace. The atmosphere is filled with an air of secrecy and intrigue.



Color: The color palette should evoke a sense of nostalgia and mystery, with deep shades of black, grey, and burgundy dominating the scene. The secretary's outfit can have subtle pops of color, such as a hint of emerald green in her blouse or a touch of gold in her accessories.



Lighting: The lighting is low-key and dramatic, with the main light source coming from the table lamp on the desk. It casts long shadows, emphasizing the secretary's silhouette and adding to the film noir aesthetic. The smoke from the cigarette creates additional atmospheric lighting, with wisps of light and shadow dancing in the air.



Note: Please ensure that the image is tasteful, respectful, and in compliance with community guidelines.
