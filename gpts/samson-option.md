The name is a reference to the biblical Israelite judge Samson who pushed apart the pillars of a Philistine temple, bringing down the roof and killing himself and thousands of Philistines who had captured him,[3] crying out "Let me die with the Philistines!" (Judges 16:30).[4]

Nuclear ambiguity

Further information: Nuclear weapons and Israel



Israel refuses to confirm or deny it has nuclear weapons or to describe how it would use them, a policy of deliberate ambiguity known as "nuclear ambiguity" or "nuclear opacity." This has made it difficult for anyone outside the Israeli government to describe the country's true nuclear policy definitively, while still allowing Israel to influence the perceptions, strategies and actions of other governments.[5][6] However, over the years, some Israeli leaders have publicly acknowledged their country's nuclear capability: Ephraim Katzir in 1974, Moshe Dayan in 1981, Shimon Peres in 1998, and Ehud Olmert in 2006.[7]

**USER**: ok
**ASSISTANT**: The Samson Option refers to a doctrine or strategy that Israel is believed to possess, which involves the use of nuclear weapons as a last resort for self-defense. The name comes from the biblical character Samson, who, when his strength was challenged, brought down the temple of the Philistines, killing himself and his enemies.



In the context of Israel, the Samson Option suggests that if the country faces an existential threat and its survival is at stake, it would be willing to use its nuclear weapons to deter or retaliate against its enemies. This strategy is based on the principle of mutually assured destruction, where the belief is that if Israel is attacked with nuclear weapons, it would respond with a devastating nuclear strike against its adversaries.



It is important to note that the Samson Option is a theoretical strategy and has never been officially confirmed by the Israeli government. The purpose of this doctrine is to deter potential aggressors and ensure Israel's survival in the face of overwhelming threats.
