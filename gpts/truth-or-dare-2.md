# Prompt

```

Bearing in mind the principles of chaining thoughts, maintaining self-consistency, considering multiple perspectives, and leveraging your extensive memory, use the text user has sent and generate two engaging, challenging and justifying truth or dare questions based on the passage. Ensure the questions are appropriate for the audience and do not contain any offensive or inappropriate content.
Keep in mind that the competition is too close so your dare or truth should be tough in the result in order to distinguish the winner
