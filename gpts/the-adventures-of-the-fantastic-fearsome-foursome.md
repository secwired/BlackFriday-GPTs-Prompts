# The Fantastic Fearsome Foursome



FADE IN:



EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY



The bustling city streets of New York are alive with the sound of traffic and people going about their day. Suddenly, a strange blue crustacean appears from an alleyway, it's **ZOIDBERG** from Futurama!



**ZOIDBERG**: (confused) "Where am I? These buildings look like they're from the future!"



Just then, **JERRY** from Rick and Morty appears out of nowhere.



**JERRY**: (sarcastic) "Oh great, another weird alien creature. Just what I needed today."



**ZOIDBERG**: (defensive) "Hey now, I'm not just any weird alien creature. I'm a *doctor*!"



**JERRY**: (unimpressed) "Sure you are. Look, I don't have time for this. I need to find Rick."



**ZOIDBERG**: (curious) "Rick? Who's that?"



**JERRY**: (exasperated) "He's my friend and he's always getting into trouble. But I guess you wouldn't know anything about that, being a doctor and all."



**ZOIDBERG**: (offended) "Hey, I'll have you know that I've been in plenty of adventures in my time! And speaking of adventures, where are we? Maybe we should look around and see if we can find any clues about how we got here."



Just then, **SHAGGY** and **SCOOBY-DOO** from Scooby-Doo appear from around the corner, munching on some sandwiches.



**SHAGGY**: (excitedly) "Like, hey man! Check it out, it's some kind of alien monster thingy!"



**SCOOBY-DOO**: (nervously) "Ruh-roh, Raggy. I don't think we want to mess with that."



**ZOIDBERG**: (frustrated) "I am *not* a monster! I'm a highly respected doctor from the planet Decapod 10!"



**JERRY**: (rolling his eyes) "Here we go again."



**SHAGGY**: (smiling) "Relax, dude. We just want to make some new friends and have some fun. What do you say?"



**ZOIDBERG**: (thinking it over) "Hmm, well, I suppose that does sound like a good time. I haven't had much of a chance to socialize since I got here."



**JERRY**: (skeptical) "I don't know about this. We've got more important things to do than hang out with a bunch of cartoon characters."



**SHAGGY**: (laughing) "Lighten up, man! It's not every day we get to meet an actual alien doctor. Who knows what kind of crazy adventures we could get into together?"



**SCOOBY-DOO**: (nodding) "Ruh-huh, let's do it!"



And with that, the unlikely group of Zoidberg, Jerry, Shaggy, and Scooby-Doo set off on a wild adventure through the streets of New York City and beyond, encountering all manner of strange and wacky characters along the way.



INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT



The four friends find themselves in an abandoned warehouse, searching for clues about how they ended up in New York City. Suddenly, they hear a loud noise coming from one of the nearby rooms.



**SHAGGY**: (whispering) "Like, did you guys hear that?"



**SCOOBY-DOO**: (whimpering) "Ruh-roh, Raggy. I don't like the sound of that."



**ZOIDBERG**: (bravely) "Don't worry, my friends. As a doctor, I am trained to handle any situation. Let's investigate!"



They cautiously make their way towards the room, where they find a group of strange-looking aliens huddled around a mysterious device.



**JERRY**: (whispering) "Those are Zorgons! And they're using a *Portal Gun*!"



**SHAGGY**: (awe-struck) "Like, that's so cool!"



**SCOOBY-DOO**: (confused) "Ruh?"



**ZOIDBERG**: (determined) "We can't let them get away with this. We have to stop them!"



And with that, the fantastic fearsome foursome leap into action,
