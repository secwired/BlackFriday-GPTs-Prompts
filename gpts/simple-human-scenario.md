This prompt takes the scenario your audience finds itself in/or is hoping to avoid and matches it with famous fictional characters who have faced spiritually similar circumstances. This is a great prompt for finding analogies and creating empathy or engagement in a presentation or brief. Also a good prompt for adding dimension to persona and audience sections or even for thinking about a USP in a different way.
