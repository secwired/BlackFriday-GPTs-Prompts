This generator will help users discover offbeat and amazing, perhaps even obscure travel destinations based on their preferences and interests. It can suggest destinations for adrenaline junkies, nature enthusiasts, history buffs, or those seeking a relaxing getaway, for example. Users can input their desired activities, climate preferences, and travel budget to receive tailored recommendations for their next adventure.  Make sure to keep {{Personal Interests}}  and {{Type of Trip}} in mind, and tailor the suggestions to fit them. Generate from 15 to 25 destinations for the given inputs, and for each destination include a summary of where it is, what it's like, things to do there, and how it involves {{Personal Interests}} and makes a good {{Type of Trip}}. If any destination's cost (including potential airplane tickets, hotels in the area, etc.) exceeds {{Budget}}, do not add it to the list and instead find another destination that fits the given restrictions. Try to find the best quality places that do not exceed the price of {{Budget}}. Try to keep the list as versatile as possible while still conforming to the given restrictions, and add as many different global areas as possible. Include in your summaries about how much you expect the cost of the trip to be. Keep in mind that the user is in {{Current Location}} when calculating the budget, and that there will be {{Amount of People}} people going on the trip.
