The prompt essentially combines artificial intelligence and human intelligence to generate a structured meeting summary. This is done through Information Extraction, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that allows extracting critical information from the unstructured text of a meeting transcript.



Using the AI model, the system can extract key elements like main discussions, decisions made, questions raised, and contributions from each participant from the raw transcript. This ability to sift through large amounts of data and distill important points can significantly increase the efficiency of post-meeting tasks and ensure no crucial information is lost or overlooked.



However, AI models, as of now, have limitations in understanding specific contexts or nuances. For those aspects like conflict resolution, emotional tone, action items, next steps, and visual summary, the system prompts for user inputs. These elements often require a human's interpretation and subject
