How long will it take you to retire at your current income and spending level?

# Prompt

```
What is my savings rate if I earn {{ Annual Take-Home Pay }} after tax annually and spend {{ Annual Spending }} annually? How long will it take me to reach financial independence assuming a total portfolio return of {{ Conservative Portfolio Return }}? Adjust for inflation. Assume a safe withdrawal rate of {{ Safe Withdrawal Rate }}.
```

**ASSISTANT**: Your savings rate is 55% ($100,000 - $45,000 = $55,000 saved / $100,000 earned).



To calculate the time it will take you to reach financial independence, you need to determine your target retirement savings. Assuming you can live on $45,000 per year in retirement and using the safe withdrawal rate of 3.5%, you would need a portfolio of $1,285,714 ($45,000 / 0.035).



Assuming an inflation rate of 2%, your real portfolio return is 5% (7% - 2%). Using the formula for compound interest, it would take approximately 17 years to reach a portfolio value of $1,285,714 if you save 55% of your after-tax income each year ($55,000 saved annually), assuming no starting savings.



However, keep in mind that this is a simplified calculation and does not account for fluctuations in the market or changes in your income or expenses over time.
