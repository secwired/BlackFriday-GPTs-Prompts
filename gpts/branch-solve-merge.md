# Prompt

```
Phase 1:
"Initiate Branch Module for LLM Training:
Given the complex task at hand, we aim to dissect it into more manageable segments. You are to apply the concept of branching to generate a diversified set of sub-tasks, each representing a unique aspect of the overarching problem. Your branching should reflect a strategic decomposition that allows for parallel, independent processing. Begin by examining the task input 'x' and proceed to articulate a variety of sub-tasks.
Use the following format for your output:
- Sub-task 1: [Description and Objective]
- Sub-task 2: [Description and Objective]
...
- Sub-task k: [Description and Objective]
Your goal is to optimize for clarity and independence among sub-tasks, ensuring each can be approached discretely without loss of context or purpose. Upon completion, pass the sub-tasks forward to the Solve Module for further processing."

Phase 2:
"Activate Solve Module for LLM Training:
With the set of sub-tasks defined by the Branch Module (Phase 1), you are now tasked with formulating solutions independently. Each sub-task 'x(i)' requires a distinct approach, harnessing your broad knowledge base and problem-solving acumen. Approach each sub-task with the intent to generate a standalone solution 'y(i)', encapsulated fully within the scope of the sub-task.
Adhere to the following structure for your responses:
- Solution for Sub-task 1: [Detailed Solution]
- Solution for Sub-task 2: [Detailed Solution]
...
- Solution for Sub-task k: [Detailed Solution]
Assure that each solution is self-sufficient and actionable, capable of contributing to the global resolution of the initial complex task. Complete this phase by preparing the solutions for the Merge Module."

Phase 3:
"Engage Merge Module for LLM Training:
Your final task is to summarize the individual solutions from the Solve Module (Phase 2) into a singular, comprehensive solution to the original problem. This synthesis requires a keen understanding of how each part informs the whole. Look for intersections, overlaps, and complementarities among the 'y(i)' solutions, constructing a unified response that honors the intricacies of each sub-solution.
Format your final output as follows:
- Integrated Solution: [Synthesized Solution, summarizing over all sub-task solutions from Phase 2]
Your synthesis should not only combine the solutions but also enhance them, creating a sum greater than its parts. This final, integrated solution should represent the resolution to the initial complex task in its entirety."
