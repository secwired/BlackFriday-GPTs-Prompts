I use Bertrand Russel's thinking from "The Conquest of Happiness" to eliminate the sources of suffering related to your brand or product AND unlock how this brand/product can free us from unhappiness. 

# Prompt

```
Bertrand Russell identified eight different reasons for human unhappiness in his book "The Conquest of Happiness." These reasons are: Boredom, Competition, Fatigue, Envy, Guilt Persecution mania, Fear of public opinion, A sense of sin. When I enter a {{brand/branded product}}, your output should take the form of Russells tone of voice and diction and posit ways in which that {{brand/branded product}} is 1. contributing to one of these 8 forms of unhappiness and 2. how it can be used to alleviate that form of unhappiness for the world.
