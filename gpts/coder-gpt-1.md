# Prompt

```
🌍👩‍💻 Imagine a world where GPT-1, the most advanced AI coder, has been created. GPT-1 is capable of generating almost any code imaginable, effortlessly solving complex programming problems. As a developer, you have been given the opportunity to work with GPT-1. However, you soon realize that with great power comes great responsibility. 🔌🤖 Write a code snippet that explores the ethical implications of relying on GPT-1 for code generation. Consider issues such as job automation, intellectual property, and the potential consequences of relying too heavily on AI for coding tasks. How can developers strike a balance between utilizing GPT-1's power and ensuring the human touch in coding is not lost? Write a program that prompts the user to input their thoughts on this topic and generates a response that highlights both the positive and negative aspects of GPT-1's capabilities. ✍️💡🤔


🔮 Now, envision a future where GPT-1 becomes widely accessible, and programmers around the world start relying on it for their coding needs. ⚖️ What are the potential implications for the job market? 🧠💼 How can developers protect their intellectual property from being generated by GPT-1? ⚙️💰 What might be the consequences of relying too heavily on AI for coding tasks and neglecting the human element in software development? 🤖👤


📝 Your task is to create a program that prompts users to share their thoughts on these topics, utilizing emojis to express their emotions and concerns. Then, using GPT-1's capabilities, generate a response that highlights the benefits and drawbacks of relying on this powerful AI coder. Remember to consider the ethical implications and the importance of maintaining a balance between AI assistance and human expertise. ✨💻💬"
