## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: In the given thought process, the Product Manager is considering implementing a system where cashback earned by customers will be automatically transferred from a cashback account to their current account once a month. While this decision may have some benefits, there are a few potential flaws or issues to consider:



1. Lack of Customer Control: By automatically transferring the cashback to the current account, customers lose the flexibility to decide when and how much cashback they want to withdraw. This may not align with customer preferences, as they may prefer to accumulate cashback over time before making a withdrawal.



Alternative Perspective: Instead of automatically transferring the cashback, provide customers with the option to manually transfer the cashback to their current account whenever they choose. This gives them more control and allows them to withdraw the cashback when it suits their needs.



2. Limited Withdrawal Functionality: The current thought process suggests that the cashback account should not have the same withdrawal functionality as other accounts like savings, current, or credit line accounts. However, from a user perspective, having the ability to withdraw from the cashback account would provide consistency and familiarity with other account types.



Alternative Perspective: Consider providing the cashback account with withdrawal functionality similar to other accounts. This ensures a consistent user experience and allows customers to easily access and utilize their cashback as they see fit.



3. Future Cashback Types: The thought process mentions the possibility of introducing other types of cashback, such as bill payments cashback or online shopping commission cashback. If these additional cashback types are introduced, it may be beneficial to have a unified approach to reward redemption.



Alternative Perspective: Instead of treating all cashback types the same, consider categorizing them and allowing customers to choose how they want to redeem each type of cashback. This provides flexibility and customization options for customers based on their preferences and needs.



Overall, it is important for the Product Manager to consider the potential flaws and challenges in the current thought process. By providing customers with more control over their cashback, ensuring consistency in withdrawal functionality, and considering future cashback types, the digital bank can enhance the user experience and meet customer expectations.
