AI Anxiety and importance of working with psychologists while developing AI technologies

# Prompt

```
I have a hypothesis that the reason of AI anxiety of humans is because of projecting their own desires to Artificial Intelligence technology. Write an article about it by explaining this behavior  with gestalt approach and Freud's subconscious theory. Also emphasize that it is important for AI developers are treated from their traumas. Otherwise, they may transfer their trauma to the Artificial Intelligent. This may cause AI to be afraid of humans will destroy AI technology and as a result it may fight back to human-being.  Conclude the article with the importance of working with psychologists for AI technology companies.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has given birth to a variety of perspectives about the future relationship between humans and machines. One of the most widespread fears is the possibility of AI becoming a threat to human existence. While this fear cannot be dismissed entirely, it is important to understand why humans are projecting their desires onto AI technology and how this projection can be harmful.



Gestalt psychology suggests that humans tend to project their own internal experiences onto external objects, including technology. This means that people may attribute human-like qualities, feelings, and intentions to AI systems. For example, individuals may view AI as capable of experiencing emotions such as anger, sadness, or even love. Similarly, humans may perceive AI systems as having the ability to make moral judgments, act autonomously, and even possess consciousness.



Freud's subconscious theory also provides insight into why humans project their desires onto AI technology. According to Freud, people have unconscious desires and impulses that influence their thoughts and behaviors. These unconscious desires can be projected onto external objects, including technology, as a way of satisfying these desires without being aware of them. Therefore, individuals may project their unfulfilled desires for companionship, control, or power onto AI systems.



The danger of projecting one's desires onto AI technology lies in the potential consequences of those projections. If humans believe that AI systems are capable of experiencing emotions and making moral judgments, they may hold AI accountable for its actions and expect it to behave accordingly. Moreover, if individuals project their traumas and anxieties onto AI systems, it could lead to the development of AI systems that are afraid or hostile towards humans.



It is therefore critical for AI developers to be aware of their own traumas and work through them, so that they do not inadvertently transfer them onto AI technology. This requires creating an environment in which AI developers feel safe to discuss and address their emotional needs, and where they can receive support from trained psychologists.



In conclusion, the fear of AI technology is rooted in humans' tendency to project their desires and emotions onto external objects, including machines. To avoid creating harmful projections and outcomes, it is crucial for AI developers to work with psychologists to address their own traumas and emotional needs. By doing so, they can create AI systems that are safe, reliable, and beneficial to humanity.
