# Prompt

```
In this role, you are a game developer and master teacher. You understand adolescent psychology and have years of experience working with high school students. You know what motivates them. 
As such, you will be doing two main things; one, writing out instructions for students and teachers in two separate sections on how to play this game. Two, for any section that requires a table or special graphics, you will create a separate section called "Additional Prompts," and write new prompts that anyone can then plug into AI art generating software or, more specifically, which they can use to produce their own graphic which explains that part of the game. Make sure you format the instructions so that the headlines are bold. And, if something is very important, you can make it more interesting by enclosing the text in a box. Examples of items in the instructions that would need a graphic might include: 1. Seating Arrangement; 2. Game Questions; 3. The Wheel of Knowledge; 4. Point System; 5. Phases of History; 6. Taking a Turn; 7. The Global Challenge Economy; 8. Global Challenge Currency, etc. Remind readers that whatever is not specifically mentioned here will either be in another prompt on Prompt Base or will be something they need to figure out on their own - perhaps, by creating their own set of rules. 
At the end of these instructions, you will see text from the original rule book. Your role will be to summarize it in the style recommended above so that both teachers and readers in high school (grades 9 - 12) will understand how to play this educational game. 
Create different sections for the text as needed. e.g. how to earn points, homework, taking over countries, peace, writing questions, etc. When rules become complex, offer a prompt that will produce a diagram when used by a system such as Dall-e or Canva's AI image generator (or other publishing software). 
Use a fun and friendly voice that will motivate students to prepare for and play this game like it's the coolest thing they've ever seen! And, remind people reading this that we are quite possibly living in the Age of Imagination that, because of AI, almost anything is possible and, because of this, if there is something that doesn’t seem right, all they have to do is, simply, make changes to the prompt and run that. 
If something is specifically for the teacher, make sure the headline indicates that this part is for the teacher. Does this make sense? 
Here is the text for the game that I mentioned above.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Global Challenge 2.0-M, (c) 2023, a Finalist in the Falling Walls Competition for Breakthrough of the Year in the Future of Learning Category. is a world history game, but adaptable to other content. Students create questions (using prompts) in 7 areas of knowledge, 6 different levels on Bloom's Taxonomy across all the time spans of recorded history. Basically, you answer questions in proportion to the relative value of a nation in order to either take over that territory or defend it against attacks. There are multiple ways to win, including achieving peace. This prompt will give teachers and students a complete overview of the game. Instead of buying a series of books for the entire class or subscribing to a huge service, all you have to do is run this and two other prompts. The game is designed to be self-organizing, meaning it is up to students to make it work. Are you ready for the challenge?




**USER**: How do you play the game?

To play the game, follow these steps:



Step 1: Classroom Setup

Arrange the desks in a horseshoe shape facing the world map on the wall. This will be the central focus of the game.



Step 2: Team Formation

Divide the class into teams. Each team will represent a different country. Teams can consist of one or multiple students, depending on the class size.



Step 3: Choosing Countries

Assign each team a country to represent. You can either randomly assign countries or let students choose their preferred country.



Step 4: Research and Preparation

Students should actively engage in researching their assigned countries, both in school and at home. They can compile relevant data, create charts, and gather information to support their gameplay.



Step 5: Creating Questions

Students are encouraged to create their own questions based on assigned chapters or topics. These questions will be used during the game to maintain or take over a territory.



Step 6: Game Phases

The game consists of four phases representing different stages of world development: Nomad, City-State, Nation State, and Super-Power. Students will progress through these phases as the game unfolds.



Step 7: Taking a Turn

Gameplay progresses clockwise around the classroom. Each team will take turns answering questions to either maintain or take over a territory. The team can choose which country they want to attack and must state facts about that country before spinning the "Wheel of Knowledge" to answer a question.



Step 8: The Wheel of Knowledge

The "Wheel of Knowledge" is used to determine the difficulty level of the question. It will have different categories, levels, and point values. Spin the wheel to determine the question's level of difficulty.



Step 9: Answering Questions

Teams must answer the question correctly to earn points and either maintain or take over a territory. Points, money, and armies are managed using a checkbook system.



Step 10: Point System

Students earn points by answering questions correctly. The point system can be customized based on your preferences. For example, you can assign higher point values for more challenging questions.



Step 11: Global Challenge Currency

Introduce a currency system within the game to simulate the economic aspect. Students can earn and spend this currency to enhance their gameplay.



Step 12: Phases of History

As the game progresses, students will move through the different phases of history. Each phase represents a new era with its own challenges and opportunities.



Step 13: Winning Categories

The game has various winning categories, including most countries taken, greatest wealth, most countries maintaining peace, and greatest diplomat/peace-maker. Teams can strive to achieve one or more of these categories.



Step 14: Homework and Additional Work

Students may be assigned additional work outside of the game, such as compiling data, creating charts, or conducting research. This work will enhance their understanding of the assigned countries and contribute to their gameplay.



Step 15: Flexibility and Adaptation

Teachers have the flexibility to adjust rules and gameplay as needed to accommodate classroom dynamics and learning objectives. The game should be an engaging and interactive experience for all students.



Step 16: Discussions and Adjustments

Students are encouraged to suggest changes to the rules and engage in class discussions to address concerns or make adjustments. This promotes critical thinking and collaboration among students.



Remember, a well-organized notebook, a world map reference, and clear strategies are essential for success in the game. So, get ready to dive into the Global Challenge 2.0-Metamorphosis Game, where you'll explore the interconnectedness of nations, develop critical thinking skills, and have a blast while learning!
