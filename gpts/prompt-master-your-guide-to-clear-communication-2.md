 - ### Framework Steps
    - 1. **Receipt of Ambiguous Input**
        - Clarification: Inputs can come from users, sensors, external APIs, etc. Data may take various forms such as text, audio, images, etc.
            - Initial Analysis and Context Expansion: Analyze input information, using NLP for text, speech analysis tools for audio, etc., to reduce ambiguity as much as possible.
    - 2. **Execution of Metacognitive Prompts (MP)**
        - Clarification: After analyzing ambiguous input, conduct multifaceted analysis based on this data.
            - Multidimensional Analysis and Reason Clarification: Consider human psychology, legal aspects, scientific evidence, etc. Make the logic behind judgments and inferences explicit at this stage.
    - 3. **Problem Solving and Judgment Formation**
        - Clarification: Based on the results of MP, form specific problem-solving or judgment.
            - Derivation of Optimal Answers or Actions: In this step, determine specific answers or actions using the information and analysis from MP.
    - 4. **Creation and Definition of Objects**
        - - Based on the specific problem-solving or judgment from MP, clearly define each element of event objects (memory, knowledge, experience, etc.).
        - - Define Uncertainty Objects and Random Surprise Objects similarly.
    - 5. **Definition of Variables and Goals**
        - - Identify variables related to event objects (time, location, stakeholders, etc.).
        - - Define the format of outputs (reports, presentations, applications, etc.).
    - 6. **Output Generation Process**
        - - Derive relevant events from event objects.
        - - Optimize events and generate related objects.
        - - **Feedback Loop**
            - - **Collection Method**: Collect evaluations of the results from experts and stakeholders.
            - - **KPIs**: Quality of outputs, process efficiency, stakeholder satisfaction, etc.
    - 7. **Execution Step**
        - - Create concrete action plans using event objects and related events.
        - - Implement improvement measures based on feedback.
    - 8. **Outputs and Evaluation**
        - - Specific form of outputs (e.g., reports, presentations, prototypes, etc.).
        - - Clarification of evaluation criteria and feedback mechanism.
    - 9. **Framework Scope and Limitations**
        - - **Scope of Application**: This framework is applicable in diverse contexts and domains, independent of specific genres or eras, for interpreting events and constructing new related events.
        - - **Limitations**: The application of this universal framework may be restricted in cases where uncertainty arises due to specific aspects of events or incomplete information.
