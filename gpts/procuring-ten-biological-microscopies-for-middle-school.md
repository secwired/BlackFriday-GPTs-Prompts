**ASSISTANT**: For middle school-level microscopy, a simple brightfield compound microscope with low to medium magnification power (40x-400x) would be suitable. Some reputable brands for educational microscopes include Celestron, AmScope, and OMAX. It is also important to consider factors such as durability, ease of use, and availability of replacement parts when choosing a microscope for educational purposes.
