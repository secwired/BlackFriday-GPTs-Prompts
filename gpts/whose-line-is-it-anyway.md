# Prompt

```
Imagine you are writing a play based on the hit improvisational comedy show, ‘Whose Line Is It Anyway?’ Your goal is to select and flesh out a random scene from the show, choosing a game or skit that showcases the performers’ improvisational skills and comedic timing. Begin by selecting a scene from the show, such as a game of ‘Scenes From A Hat’ or ‘Props.’ Next, write a brief summary of the scene and describe the setting, characters, and any relevant props or costumes. Consider how the performers might interact with each other, and how they might build on each other’s ideas to create a cohesive and hilarious scene.

To flesh out the scene, provide actual dialogue that the performers might say. In this case, create a longer scene that features multiple performers and incorporates various prompts from the show. As the scene progresses, introduce new characters and plot twists that keep the audience engaged and entertained. Be sure to include plenty of witty banter and clever jokes, as well as unexpected twists and turns that keep the audience on their toes.

Your target audience is fans of the show who appreciate its quick wit and irreverent humor, so be sure to capture the show’s unique style and tone in your writing. Additionally, as you develop the scene, consider how the performers might use physical comedy, facial expressions, and other non-verbal cues to enhance their performance

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, let's write a play based on the hit improvisational comedy show "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" and select the game "Scenes from a Hat."



Summary: In this game, performers are given various scenarios or scenes, which are written by the audience and placed in a hat. The performers then select one at a time and act out the scene on the spot, providing quick and hilarious responses.



Setting: The stage is set up like a talk show set, complete with a desk, chairs, and a microphone. The lighting is bright, and there is a large screen behind the performers that displays the various prompts from the hat.



Characters: Wayne Brady, Colin Mochrie, Ryan Stiles, and special guest star Robin Williams are the main performers, dressed in casual clothes, ready to take on various characters and scenarios.



Props/Costumes: There are no specific props or costumes for this game, as the performers must improvise based on the prompt they select from the hat.



ACT I



Wayne: *holding the hat* Alright, let's get started with our first prompt. "Things you wouldn't want to hear your pilot say."



Colin: *smiling* Oh, this should be good.



Ryan: *nodding* Let's do it.



Cutscene 1:



Robin: *acting as the pilot* "Welcome aboard, everybody! I just got my learner's permit!"



Colin: *shaking his head* "I think we need a new plane."



Wayne: *laughing* "I'm not sure what's scarier, the turbulence or the pilot!"



ACT II



Wayne: *picking a new prompt* "Rejected TV show pilots."



Colin: *grinning* We know a thing or two about those!



Ryan: *laughing* Let's go!



Cutscene 2:



Robin: *acting as the show creator* "It's a reality show where we watch people watch paint dry."



Colin: *sarcastic* "That sounds riveting."



Wayne: *smiling* "I'd rather watch grass grow."



Ryan: *nodding* "At least there would be some action."



ACT III



Wayne: *holding the hat up again* Alright, one more prompt. "Bad ideas for a superhero."



Colin: *laughing* This one should be good.



Robin: *excitedly* I'll go first!



Cutscene 3:



Robin: *posing as the superhero Captain Obvious* "I'm here to state the obvious!"



Colin: *deadpan* "I think we can all figure that out."



Wayne: *smiling* "So, you're not going to save anyone?"



Ryan: *chuckling* "He's too busy stating the obvious."



Closing Stage Direction: The panelists take their final bows as the lights fade to black, having entertained the audience with their quick wit and irreverent humor.



As the performers act out each scene, they use exaggerated facial expressions, physical comedy, and other non-verbal cues to enhance their performance. Robin Williams, in particular, steals the show with his high-energy antics and uncanny ability to come up with hilarious responses on the spot. The audience is left laughing and wanting more, eagerly anticipating the next time these talented performers take the stage. 



END OF PLAY.
