1. S - Substitute: Think about potential substitutions that can improve or replace existing products, services, or processes within the company. For example, can we substitute certain materials used in production with more sustainable alternatives?



2. C - Combine: Explore opportunities to combine different elements, ideas, or features within the company to create something new. For instance, can we combine different departments or teams to foster cross-functional collaboration?



3. A - Adapt: Consider how existing products, services, or processes can be adapted or modified to meet changing customer needs or market trends. For example, can we adapt our current product to target a new customer segment?



4. M - Modify or Magnify: Think about ways to modify or magnify existing features or characteristics of the company's offerings. This could involve enhancing certain functionalities or making improvements to existing processes.



5. P - Put to another use: Explore alternative applications or markets for the company's products or services. Can we find new uses for our existing products or target different industries?



6. E - Eliminate: Identify aspects, processes, or features that can be eliminated or simplified to streamline operations or enhance customer experience. Are there any unnecessary steps in our current processes that can be removed?



7. R - Reverse or Rearrange: Consider reversing the order of steps or rearranging the sequence of processes to create a fresh perspective. This can help identify new efficiencies or uncover hidden opportunities.
