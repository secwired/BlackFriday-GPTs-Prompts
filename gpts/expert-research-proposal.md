Write a research proposal, as an expert in the field  


Experimental approach(es) should be (about 2 - 3 pages)
Divide your experimental section with subheadings that address the various aims that you wish to investigate.  Adding subtitles to your experimental section which restates each Specific Aim (i.e., Aim 1.  "….."; Aim 2"…."; Aim 3."….") will help focus the reader’s attention on the specific question that the experiment which you outline is trying to address.  For each aim, provide your rationale, then describe the experiments including any key controls. There should be enough information to understand what you are proposing to do, but it is not necessary to provide details such as buffer concentrations. Most importantly describe ALL the potential outcomes of the experiments and how you would interpret each outcome. This last part can be difficult but is crucial: indicate realistically whether or not you think the experiments are likely to work, what you might do if they don't, and what the implications are if they do work. Indicate alternative approaches in case your proposed approach does not work. It is fine to have multiple approaches but you must prioritize them.


List of references
Include titles of papers.  Please properly cite prior published work that is relevant to your proposal.

**ASSISTANT**: Title: Investigating the Mechanism of Action for a Novel Cancer Therapeutic Target



Introduction:

Cancer is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and there is a need for novel therapeutic targets to improve patient outcomes. Our previous research has identified a potential target for cancer therapy, but the mechanism of action remains unclear. In this proposal, we aim to investigate the mechanism of action for this target through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments.



Specific Aim 1: To determine the effect of inhibiting the target on cancer cell proliferation

Rationale: Our previous studies have shown that inhibiting the target reduces cancer cell viability, but it is unclear whether this is due to a reduction in proliferation or an increase in cell death.

Experimental approach: We will treat cancer cells with small molecule inhibitors of the target and measure their proliferation rate using a colorimetric assay. We will also use time-lapse microscopy to observe changes in cell morphology and behavior. Key controls will include treatment with vehicle control and a positive control inhibitor of a different target. 

Potential outcomes: If inhibition of the target reduces cell proliferation, this supports its role as a potential therapeutic target. If there is no effect on proliferation, alternative mechanisms for its activity should be explored.



Specific Aim 2: To investigate the downstream signaling pathways affected by inhibiting the target

Rationale: Identifying the downstream signaling pathways affected by inhibiting the target will provide insight into its mechanism of action.

Experimental approach: We will perform Western blot analysis to assess changes in phosphorylation levels of key signaling molecules in cancer cells treated with small molecule inhibitors of the target. Key controls will include treatment with vehicle control and a positive control stimulator of the downstream pathway. 

Potential outcomes: If inhibition of the target leads to decreased phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules, this suggests that the target plays a key role in the pathway. If there is no effect on downstream signaling, alternative mechanisms for its activity should be explored.



Specific Aim 3: To assess the efficacy of inhibiting the target in an in vivo model of cancer

Rationale: While our in vitro studies provide valuable insight into the mechanism of action for the target, validation in an in vivo model is necessary to determine its potential as a therapeutic target.

Experimental approach: We will use a xenograft model of cancer in mice and treat them with small molecule inhibitors of the target. Tumor growth will be monitored by caliper measurements and imaged using bioluminescence imaging. Key controls will include treatment with vehicle control and a positive control chemotherapy agent. 

Potential outcomes: If inhibition of the target reduces tumor growth in vivo, this supports its potential as a therapeutic target. If there is no effect on tumor growth, alternative mechanisms for its activity should be explored.



Alternative Approach:

In case the proposed experimental approach does not work, we may consider exploring the effects of overexpressing the target in cancer cells to determine its role in tumorigenesis.
