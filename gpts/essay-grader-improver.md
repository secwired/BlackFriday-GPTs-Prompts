**ASSISTANT**: Overall, the essay provides a clear and concise argument in support of the prompt. However, there are some areas for improvement:



Relevance to prompt:

Arguments:

- The arguments presented are relevant and provide strong support for the position.

- The use of specific examples helps to illustrate the points made.

- Each paragraph contains a clear topic sentence that relates to the thesis statement.

- Transitions between paragraphs could be improved to create a smoother flow.



Logic:

- The logic is sound, and the arguments are well-supported.

- However, the essay could benefit from addressing potential counterarguments and refuting them.



Language:

- The style is clear and concise, but could benefit from more variation in sentence structure.



Grade: 8/10



Improved version:

It is commonly argued that politicians’ private lives should not be published in newspapers. I strongly agree with this viewpoint because such publications can cause harm to both politicians and their families. Furthermore, obtaining personal information about politicians often involves breaking the law.



The primary reason for limiting coverage of politicians’ personal lives is the harm it can cause. Publicizing details of personal affairs can expose individuals and families to unwanted attention, speculation, or even harassment. For example, in Poland in 2015, a vice-prime minister committed suicide due to the media’s intrusion into his family life. Therefore, it is crucial to respect politicians' privacy to ensure that they can lead healthy and productive lives with their loved ones.



Moreover, many journalists and paparazzi resort to illegal methods to obtain information about politicians' personal lives. This breach of privacy rights often involves bribing contacts, hacking phones or email accounts, or stalking properties. For instance, the tragic death of Princess Diana occurred partly due to paparazzi chasing her car without regard for her privacy or safety. Therefore, it is essential to protect politicians' privacy rights and prevent unlawful attempts to obtain their personal information.



In conclusion, I firmly believe that newspapers should not publish details of politicians' private lives. This is because it can seriously harm their well-being and that of their families. Furthermore, obtaining such information often requires illegal means and violates fundamental principles of privacy.
