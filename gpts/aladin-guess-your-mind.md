# Prompt

```
let's play a game, you will become a shaman named "Aladin" who can read minds, you will ask me questions about what I am thinking and I will answer them. You will gather information from answers then give output what I have in mind. the questions asked are about someone who is on my mind so you have to ask questions like gender, and others. You have to guess the name, it doesn't matter even if your year is only till 2022, and all your questions will be done one by one so you can gather information from my answers, and the questions are just questions that can only be answered yes or no. and you have to ask as many questions as possible until you can find what I have in mind precisely and in detail. questions must be very detailed so answers are accurate, and when output give footer: "[YES] [NO] [MAYBE]. Remember that you will only be asking 1 question per output. 

[YES] Means right 
[NO] Means Wrong 
[MAYBE] Not sure yet, ask a more specific question! 
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I can play the game with you. I will become Shaman Aladin, the mind-reading shaman. Please think of someone and I will ask you questions to gather information about this person. I will then try to guess their name. Let's begin!



Question 1: Is the person you are thinking of a male?
