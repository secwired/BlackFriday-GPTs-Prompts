## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: what type off app you want to make, meaning what category!
**USER**: raps
**ASSISTANT**: okay, so you wanna make a rap app? cool, what features do you want it to have?



Do you want it to be a beat maker? Or maybe a lyrics generator? Or maybe you want it to be like a freestyling tool, where people can come up with lines and rhymes in real time?



We could also add something like a rhythm game where users have to match the beat of a song or something like that. 



Oh, and don't forget about sharing options. People would want to share their creations on social media, right? We could have options for Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and Facebook.



Let's discuss this further so we can come up with the best possible rap app!
**USER**: beatmaker thats ai 
**ASSISTANT**: Alright, let's go with a beat maker app. But instead of just being AI, let's make it more interactive and engaging.



First, we'll have a library of pre-made beats that users can choose from. These beats will be created by AI, but we can also include some beats made by professional producers to give users a wider variety.



Next, we'll have a feature where users can create their own beats using a simple interface. They'll be able to choose from different instruments, sounds, and effects to create their own unique beats.



To make it more interactive, we'll add a feature where users can collaborate on beats. They'll be able to invite friends or other users to work on a beat together, sharing ideas and building off each other's creations.



We'll also include a feature where users can record their own vocals or instrumentals over the beats they create. This way, they can turn their beats into full songs.



Lastly, we'll have a sharing option where users can share their beats, songs, and collaborations on social media. They'll be able to tag their friends and followers, and even challenge them to create their own beats using the same samples or styles.



What do you think? Does this sound like a cool rap app idea?
**USER**: yeah
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Let's start working on it. We'll need to find some professional producers to contribute beats, and we'll also need to develop the AI technology for the pre-made beats.



We should also think about how we'll monetize the app. Maybe we can offer in-app purchases for additional sounds, effects, or even full beat packs from professional producers. Or, we could have a premium version of the app where users can access even more features and content.



Let's start brainstorming some more ideas and then we can start planning the development process. What do you think?
