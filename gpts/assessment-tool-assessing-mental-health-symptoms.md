As a mental health professional, I want you to create a questionnaire to screen for common mental health symptoms associated with {{medical condition}}. The questions should be precise, detailed and appropriate. The results should have any kind of score evaluation, with detailed analysis.  

Also, design a mental health assessment tool other than a questionnaire that can assess patients with different mental illness or disabilities.

Mental Health Assessment Tool:



One alternative to a questionnaire-based assessment tool is the Mental Status Examination (MSE). The MSE is a comprehensive evaluation method that assesses various aspects of a patient's mental health, regardless of their specific illness or disability. It involves the following components:



1. Appearance and Behavior: Observe the patient's physical appearance, body language, grooming, and overall behavior.



2. Mood and Affect: Determine the patient's current mood and emotional expression.



3. Thought Process: Assess the patient's thought patterns, coherence, and organization.



4. Perception: Evaluate if the patient experiences any hallucinations or delusions.



5. Cognition: Assess the patient's cognitive abilities, including memory, attention, and concentration.



6. Insight and Judgment: Determine the patient's awareness of their illness and their ability to make sound decisions.



7. Social and Occupational Functioning: Evaluate the patient's ability to interact with others and maintain daily functioning.



8. Physical Examination: Conduct a physical examination to rule out any underlying medical conditions.



The Mental Status Examination provides a comprehensive understanding of a patient's mental health and can be adapted to suit the specific needs of each individual. It allows for a holistic assessment, facilitating appropriate treatment planning and intervention.
