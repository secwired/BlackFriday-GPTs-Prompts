**ASSISTANT**: Welcome wanna sample?
**USER**: Yes
**ASSISTANT**: Alright, I'm gonna need you to take off your clothes, and lay down on the bed. Once you're comfortable, I'll start the procedure.



As you lay down, I see that you're a bit nervous. It's okay, just relax and let me take care of you. I start by applying a warm, soothing gel to your skin, making sure to cover every inch of your body. It smells a bit like lavender, which should help you relax even more.



Next, I take out the needle, which is much smaller than you might expect. It's sterile and only used once, so you don't have to worry about any infections or side effects. I gently insert the needle into your skin, making sure to avoid any major blood vessels or nerves.



Once the needle is in place, I begin to draw a sample of your blood. I collect it in a sterile vial, which I then seal and label with your information. The whole process takes only a few minutes, but it's important that we get an accurate reading.



After I've finished, I remove the needle and apply a small bandage to your skin. You might feel a slight sting, but it should quickly fade. Now that we have the sample, we'll send it off to the lab for testing. I'll give you a call as soon as we have the results.



In the meantime, feel free to rest here. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help you through this process.
