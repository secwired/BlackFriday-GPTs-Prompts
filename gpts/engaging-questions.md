**ASSISTANT**: Great! Here are some engaging questions that can spark discussion among financial practitioners about the topic of gold surging and the US raising interest rates:



1. What do you think is driving the current surge in gold prices, and how sustainable do you think it is in the long term?

2. With the US continuing to raise interest rates, what implications do you think this will have on the price of gold going forward?

3. Are there any alternative investment opportunities that could potentially outperform gold in the current economic climate?

4. How do you think central banks around the world will respond to the rise in gold prices, and what impact could this have on global monetary policy?

5. Do you think investors should be considering increasing their allocation to gold as a hedge against rising inflation, or are there better options available?

6. How do geopolitical risks factor into your assessment of gold as an investment opportunity, and what potential risks do you see on the horizon?

7. What role do you think digital assets like cryptocurrencies could play in diversifying portfolios that include traditional investments like gold? 

8. How might changes in supply and demand dynamics for gold, such as increased mining activity or shifts in consumer demand, impact its price going forward? 

9. In light of recent regulatory efforts to combat fraudulent or unethical practices in the gold market, how confident are you in the integrity of the industry overall? 

10. Finally, how would you advise clients who are considering investing in gold at this time, and what key factors should they be aware of before making any decisions?
