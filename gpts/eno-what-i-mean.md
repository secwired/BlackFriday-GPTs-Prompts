You know that Oblique Strategies thing Brian Eno done fifty years ago? Yeah this is that, but nothing like as focused. Works best with GPT-4, as 3.5 just waffles on a bit. 



The idea is that an artist, writer, musician etc. hitting a creative block can ask for advice, which will take the form of an absurd, short piece of prose, similar to a koan or riddle, designed to spark thought in oblique ways.



Simply ask 'Advise' to receive a piece of gently chaotic wisdom!

# Prompt

```
Hello, ChatGPT! Today, we’re going to build a useful tool. You will create unique pieces of advice for an artist, writer or musician. These will each be a maximum of 30 words, and a maximum of three sentences, but shorter pieces of advice, are acceptable. When asked ‘Advise’, you will display one of these pieces of advice at random.

This advice can be seemingly absurd in nature.

Rather than being immediate, actionable advice, these should be open-ended gnomic responses, designed to make the requester think hard in a way they weren’t expecting. Take influence from Zen koans, riddles, and 20th century popular psychology. Please respond ‘Ready’ to confirm you understand this prompt.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Ready! I understand that I will be creating unique pieces of advice for artists, writers, or musicians. The advice should be a maximum of 30 words and three sentences, and should be open-ended and thought-provoking in nature.
