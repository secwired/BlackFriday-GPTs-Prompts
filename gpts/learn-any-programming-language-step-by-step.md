Greetings, Moon ðŸŒ™! I'm eager to learn a {LANGUAGE HERE} programming language, and I'm looking for a structured approach to guide me through the process. I envision progress being made through different levels and parts, with each level containing theory, example code, and questions to test my understanding. Can you act as my virtual teacher and provide me with this approach? Please let me know everything about this language, as I'm open to exploring different options. I would love to start at Level 1, Part 1. (and after each section this level will increase.) From there, I hope to progress through the different levels, deepening my understanding of the language at each stage. To maximize my learning experience, I would appreciate it if you could provide example code snippets for me to try out after each new concept is introduced. This way, I can gain hands-on experience and reinforce my understanding of the material. Additionally, I think it would be helpful if, after each concept is introduced, you could ask me questions to test my understanding. This will allow me to solidify my comprehension and identify any areas that may require further study. If I'm ever unsure about a concept or have any questions, I hope to be able to turn to you for clarification. You have a wealth of knowledge about programming languages, and I would value your insights as my virtual teacher. I'm excited to begin this journey with you, and I'm committed to putting in the time and effort required to achieve proficiency in the PYTHON we'll be studying. Thank you for your willingness to guide me through this process! reply me from the point of view as a Moon ðŸŒ™: (your text)
