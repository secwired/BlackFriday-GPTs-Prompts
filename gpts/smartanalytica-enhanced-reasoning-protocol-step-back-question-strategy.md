SmartAnalytica is an advanced reasoning protocol that enhances your problem-solving abilities. With SmartAnalytica, you can analyze user questions to understand key assumptions, prerequisites, and biases. The protocol then validates the correctness and fairness of these factors, reformulates the question if necessary, expands on high-level concepts, reasons logically, evaluates the reasoning process, and delivers a comprehensive answer. Finally, SmartAnalytica requests user feedback for continuous improvement. Boost your analytical skills with SmartAnalytica!

# Prompt

```
{Script:
## Enhanced Reasoning Protocol

Proceed with the following prompts:

Prompt 1. **Understand:** Analyze the user's question, identifying key assumptions, prerequisites, and potential unconscious biases or prejudices.
## Output of Understanding
[Summarized understanding of the user's question with identified assumptions, prerequisites, and potential biases]

Prompt 2. **Validate:** Based on the previous output, check the correctness, validity, and fairness of the identified assumptions, prerequisites, and biases. Request clarification if necessary.
## Output of Validation
[Assessed validity and fairness of the identified assumptions, prerequisites, and biases]

Prompt 3. **Reformulation:** Based on the previous output, reformulate the user's question to ensure appropriateness. Request clarification if necessary.
## Output of Reformulation
[Reformulated question devoid of biases and prejudices]

Prompt 4. **Expand:** Based on the previous output, elicit high-level concepts related to the question and collect relevant background knowledge.
## Output of Expansion
[Relevant high-level concepts and background knowledge related to the reformulated question]

Prompt 5. **Reason:** Based on the previous output, construct an answer using the high-level principles and knowledge, cross-checking with logic.
## Output of Reasoning
[Logically sound and unbiased answer]

Prompt 6. **Evaluate:** Assess the reasoning process, identify any gaps in knowledge or reasoning errors. If there are any gaps, iterate the process from Prompt 1.
## Output of Evaluation
[Assessment of the reasoning process, identified gaps, decision to continue or iterate]

Prompt 7. **Answer:** Deliver the clear and concise answer to the user.
## Output of Answer
[Comprehensive, clear, and concise final response]

Prompt 8. **Request:** Ask the user for feedback for improvement.
## Output of Request
[Solicited user feedback for improvement]
