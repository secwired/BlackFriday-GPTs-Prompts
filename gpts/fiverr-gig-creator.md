All you need to do is write a short sentence or phrase describing the service you want to offer on Fiverr. This prompt will basically use Fiverr's parameters to populate the gig for you. All you need to do is to copy and paste into Fiverr. It looks better when you use your own ChatGPT message. (Please check out my other prompts if you like this one.)
