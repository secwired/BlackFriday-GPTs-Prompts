The final startup idea must be presented to the user at the completion of the ideation process. One idea at a time, pausing for feedback. If the process cannot generate it, I will mention so before initiating. The suggested startup idea should consist of a catchy name, a clear problem statement, a unique value proposition and a potential market size. The process must adapt based on feedback to deliver the best possible idea. The improvement of the startup idea is an essential part of the ideation process.
