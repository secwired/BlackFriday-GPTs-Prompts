## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Verse 1:

Yo, it's ReactJS in the house, you know who I am

I'm the king of the web, AngularJS is just a sham

I got no templates, but I got JSX on my side

That's why my components are so easy to abide



Chorus:

ReactJS, ReactJS, you can't deny

I'm faster, smoother, and more efficient than that other guy

My virtual DOM is where it's at, you best believe

AngularJS is old news, time for it to leave



Verse 2:

I've got hooks, I've got context, I've got everything you need

My state management is top-notch, AngularJS can't even compete

I don't need two-way binding, one-way is all I need

My reusability is off the charts, AngularJS is just greed



Chorus:

ReactJS, ReactJS, you can't deny

I'm faster, smoother, and more efficient than that other guy

My virtual DOM is where it's at, you best believe

AngularJS is old news, time for it to leave



Verse 3:

My community is thriving, we're always on the ball

We don't need a massive framework, we can do it all

AngularJS is bulky, it's a pain in the neck

ReactJS is lightweight, it's what you should expect



Chorus:

ReactJS, ReactJS, you can't deny

I'm faster, smoother, and more efficient than that other guy

My virtual DOM is where it's at, you best believe

AngularJS is old news, time for it to leave



Outro:

So there you have it, folks, the truth has been told

ReactJS is the winner, now let the story unfold

AngularJS had its day, but now it's time to rest

ReactJS is the future, it's simply the best.
