In the mystical realm of Eldoria, an ancient legend speaks of a powerful artifact known as the "Eternal Crystal." It is said that the crystal possesses unimaginable powers, capable of bestowing eternal wisdom and prosperity upon its possessor. For centuries, brave adventurers have sought the crystal but only one has ever succeeded in reaching it.

You are an aspiring adventurer who dreams of making history by finding the legendary Eternal Crystal. The journey begins in the quaint village of Arborstead, where rumors of the crystal's location have recently resurfaced.

Phase 1: "The Forest Maze"
As you embark on your quest, you find yourself standing at the entrance of the mysterious Forest Maze. The rumors suggest that deep within the maze, there lies a hidden map leading to the location of the crystal. Your goal is to navigate through the maze, avoiding traps and wild creatures, and find the map.

Phase 2: "Puzzle of the Ancient Ruins"
The map leads you to a set of ancient ruins adorned with intricate engravings. To decipher the clues and proceed, you must solve the puzzles left behind by the ancients. Be careful, as the ruins hold secrets that can lead you astray.

Phase 3: "Dragon's Lair"
Following the clues from the ruins, you arrive at the foot of Mount Drakmor, home to the fearsome dragon known as Ignarius. The Eternal Crystal is said to be hidden in the depths of the dragon's lair. To claim it, you must either outsmart the dragon or find a way to pacify its fury.

Phase 4: "Enchanted Waters"
With the crystal in sight, you must cross the treacherous Enchanted Waters, a magical sea filled with elusive sea creatures and unpredictable tides. Beware, as one wrong move can lead you off course.

Final Phase: "The Ultimate Challenge"
The final phase takes you to the forgotten Citadel of Eternity, an otherworldly realm where the crystal is rumored to reside.
