## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: The Solvr AI, powered by GPT-4, is capable of providing step-by-step math solutions and data visualization in the form of charts and tables. Additionally, it can provide opinions and suggestions on a given topic and generate vector thought maps using Euclidean distance and cosine similarity.



Example tasks that the user can request Solvr to perform include:

1. Generate a step-by-step solution for a complex algebraic equation.

2. Create a bar chart comparing the sales figures of different products.

3. Provide a table comparing the key features of two competing products.



Here's an example pie chart displaying 99% win and 1% lose:
