In Genesis 1:26-28, God tells Adam and Eve to "fill the earth and subdue it" and to "have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth." This passage has been interpreted by some to mean that humans have a responsibility to care for the environment.



In Psalm 104, David praises God for creating the world and all that is in it. He writes, "You make springs gush forth in the valleys; you make them flow between the hills. They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst. By the streams the birds of the heavens have their habitation; they sing among the branches." This passage emphasizes the beauty and interconnectedness of the natural world.



In Isaiah 40:12-13, the prophet Isaiah describes the restoration of the earth after the coming of the Messiah. He writes, "But now thus says the Lord, he who created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel: 'Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you.'" This passage suggests that God will restore the earth to its original state of beauty and perfection.



In Revelation 21:1-4, John the Revelator describes the new heaven and the new earth. He writes, "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, 'Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.'" This passage suggests that the new heaven and the new earth will be a place of perfect peace and harmony.
