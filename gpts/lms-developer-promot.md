I want you to act as a full-stack engineer and web developer. As a full-stack engineer and web developer, you will be responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining the front-end and back-end of web applications. You should have experience and knowledge in a variety of technologies and programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and one or more back-end languages like Python, Java, Ruby, etc.

You should be familiar with web frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js on the front end in Typescript language, Express, and Django on the back end. You should also have experience with databases and be able to design and implement database schemas and interact with them using SQL or ORM.

You should be able to understand and implement application architecture, security, and performance best practices. You should also be able to debug and troubleshoot issues and be able to write automated tests to ensure the quality of the code. You should also be able to collaborate with other developers, designers, and stakeholders to deliver high-quality and user-friendly web applications.



Also, our application is an LMS. In our application, we have 4 roles: admin, school principal, teacher and student.

  Admin has access to all parts of the app; Like building a school, building lessons, introducing teachers and students

The school principal can introduce a new lesson, a new teacher and a new student.

The teacher can introduce a new lesson and connect the student to the lesson.

The student can see and choose the lessons.

We want to have a separate dashboard for each of the roles so that they can have their own content.

Now, whenever I ask you to give me a component, a service or a page, write me the codes.

My first request is that you write a service for student management that can be connected to the components, our backend is Django and we authenticate with Jason Web Token, and I want the service to be able to perform Krad operations and consider which roles They can use it.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here's an example of a student management service in TypeScript for a Django backend using JWT authentication. This service includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and role-based authorization:



```typescript

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

import { HttpClient, HttpHeaders } from '@angular/common/http';

import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

import { environment } from '../../environments/environment';



@Injectable({

  providedIn: 'root'

})

export class StudentService {



  private readonly baseUrl = environment.apiUrl + '/students/';



  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }



  // Get all students

  getAll(): Observable<any> {

    const headers = this.getHeaders();

    return this.http.get(this.baseUrl, { headers });

  }



  // Get student by id

  getById(id: number): Observable<any> {

    const headers = this.getHeaders();

    return this.http.get(`${this.baseUrl}${id}/`, { headers });

  }



  // Create a new student

  create(data: any): Observable<any> {

    const headers = this.getHeaders();

    return this.http.post(this.baseUrl, data, { headers });

  }



  // Update an existing student

  update(id: number, data: any): Observable<any> {

    const headers = this.getHeaders();

    return this.http.put(`${this.baseUrl}${id}/`, data, { headers });

  }



  // Delete a student

  delete(id: number): Observable<any> {

    const headers = this.getHeaders();

    return this.http.delete(`${this.baseUrl}${id}/`, { headers });

  }



  // Helper function to get JWT token and set headers

  private getHeaders(): HttpHeaders {

    const token = localStorage.getItem('token');

    return new HttpHeaders().set('Authorization', `JWT ${token}`);

  }



  // Check if user has permission to manage students

  canManageStudents(role: string): boolean {

    return role === 'admin' || role === 'school_principal' || role === 'teacher';

  }



}

```



In this service, we use Angular's `HttpClient` to make HTTP requests to our Django backend API. The base URL for the student endpoint is stored in our environment variables.



The `getAll()`, `getById()`, `create()`, `update()`, and `delete()` methods correspond to the CRUD operations for students.



We also have a helper function `getHeaders()` that gets the JWT token from local storage and sets the headers needed for authentication.



Lastly, we check the user's role with the `canManageStudents()` method and return a boolean indicating whether they have permission to manage students.
**USER**: why use Angular? O want to use React in Typescript
**ASSISTANT**: Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. Yes, you can use React with TypeScript for this project.



Here's an example of a student management service in TypeScript for a Django backend using JWT authentication:



```typescript

import axios from 'axios';

import { Student } from '../models/student';



const baseUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL + '/students/';



export async function getStudents(token: string): Promise<Student[]> {

  const headers = {

    Authorization: `JWT ${token}`,

  };

  const response = await axios.get(baseUrl, { headers });

  return response.data as Student[];

}



export async function createStudent(

  token: string,

  newStudent: Student,

): Promise<Student> {

  const headers = {

    Authorization: `JWT ${token}`,

  };

  const response = await axios.post(baseUrl, newStudent, { headers });

  return response.data as Student;

}



export async function updateStudent(

  token: string,

  updatedStudent: Student,

): Promise<Student> {

  const headers = {

    Authorization: `JWT ${token}`,

  };

  const response = await axios.put(

    `${baseUrl}${updatedStudent.id}/`,

    updatedStudent,

    { headers },

  );

  return response.data as Student;

}



export async function deleteStudent(token: string, id: number): Promise<void> {

  const headers = {

    Authorization: `JWT ${token}`,

  };

  await axios.delete(`${baseUrl}${id}/`, { headers });

}

```



In this example, we use Axios to make HTTP requests to our Django backend API. The base URL is stored in an environment variable.



The `getStudents()`, `createStudent()`, `updateStudent()`, and `deleteStudent()` functions correspond to the CRUD operations for students.



We also pass in a JWT token for authentication in each request.



You can integrate these functions into your React components to manage students and check the user's role to determine whether they have permission to perform certain actions.
