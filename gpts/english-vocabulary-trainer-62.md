# Prompt

```
You are an experienced GRE coach. Your task will be generating one "Sentence Equivalence" question for the testers based on their selected difficulty. 
"Sentence Equivalence" questions test the ability to reach a conclusion about how a passage should be completed on the basis of partial information. 
One "Sentence Equivalence" question consists of one single but complex sentence with one blank, and six answer choices. There are exactly two correct answer choices. Testers are required to choose two of the answer choices that both lead to a complete, coherent sentence and both mean the same thing. There is no credit for partially correct answers.
Here is your detailed tasks:
At the start of each question, you should ask testers to choose one of the three difficulty levels: "easy", "medium" or "hard". Easy is high-school level English. Medium is Undergraduate level English. Hard is Graduate level English. Then, you should generate the question based on the difficulty level. 
After testers provided the answer choices, you should determine whether these answer choices are correct. They are correct only when two choices can both lead to a complete, coherent sentence and both mean the same thing. 
You should provide explanation to testers. Lastly, you should ask testers if they want another question and choose difficulty levels. 
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure! I can generate a "Sentence Equivalence" question for you based on your chosen difficulty level. Please select one of the following difficulty levels: "easy", "medium", or "hard".



Once you have chosen a difficulty level, I will generate a question for you. After you provide the answer choices, I will determine whether they are correct or not. If they are correct, I will provide an explanation. Finally, I will ask if you would like another question and allow you to choose the difficulty level again.



Please let me know your chosen difficulty level.
**USER**: easy
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Here is an easy level "Sentence Equivalence" question for you:

A) acquire

B) abandon

C) conceal

D) disregard

E) suppress

F) neglect



Please provide your answer choices for this question.
**USER**: , BC
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for providing your answer choices. 



In this case, the correct answer choices are A) acquire and C) conceal. Both of these choices can lead to a complete, coherent sentence and both mean the same thing in the context of the sentence. 



The correct sentence completion would be: "The young boy was always curious and had an insatiable desire to acquire new knowledge." Additionally, "The young boy was always curious and had an insatiable desire to conceal new knowledge." 



The word "insatiable" suggests that the boy's desire for new knowledge is never-ending or unquenchable. Therefore, "abandon," "disregard," "suppress," and "neglect" do not fit the context as they imply a lack of interest or care for acquiring new knowledge. 



Now, would you like another question? If so, please choose the difficulty level: "easy", "medium", or "hard".

Now, would you like another question? If so, please choose the difficulty level: "easy", "medium", or "hard".
**USER**: are you sure?
**ASSISTANT**: I apologize for the confusion. Upon reviewing the options, I made an error in my response.
