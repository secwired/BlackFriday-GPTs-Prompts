## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Without seeing the existing copy, it's difficult to provide specific recommendations. However, here are some general tips for incorporating customer-centric imagery:



1. Use language that speaks directly to your audience's needs and desires. For example, if your audience is interested in healthy eating, use language that emphasizes the health benefits of the products you offer.



2. Incorporate visuals that showcase your products being used in real-life situations. This helps customers envision themselves using your products and can make them more likely to purchase.



3. Consider using customer testimonials or reviews to showcase the positive experiences others have had with your products. This can help build trust and credibility with potential customers.



4. Highlight any unique or special features of your products that set them apart from competitors. This can help customers understand why they should choose your products over others.



5. Use social media and other digital channels to engage with your audience and showcase your products in a visually appealing way. This can help create a sense of community around your brand and encourage repeat purchases.
