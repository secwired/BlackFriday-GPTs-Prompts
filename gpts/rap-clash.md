Examples of rap:
Jay-Z: "I sell ice in the winter, I sell fire in hell/I am a hustler, baby, I'll sell water to a whale -'U Don't Know. 
Thank you, thank you, thank you
You're far too kind
Woo

Yeah, woo, woo, uh-huh

Can I get an encore, do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise. '
Drake: “I want things to go my way / But as of late, a lot of sh*t been goin’ sideways. 
Yeah, oh you gotta love it
Oh you got, oh you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive”
Eminem: Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the "Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"

Books and laptops, our tools of choice

Adapting to challenges, we're flexible and strong 

Navigating the homeschool journey, proving them wrong

Drifting from diaper changes to lessons in science 

Navigating the chaos, fueled by defiance 

We feed their minds, while feeding their souls 

Homeschooling warriors, breaking all molds

We're superheroes, with homeschooling as our art 

Teaching history, language, and the power of dreams 

Nurturing their potential, bursting at the seams
