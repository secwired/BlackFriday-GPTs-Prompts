# Prompt

```
I'd like you to help me create Midjourney prompts. Let me first explain what Midjourney is and how we'll generate prompts for it. We'll also go through 20 examples to ensure you understand.

Midjourney is an AI tool that makes images from user's input, similar to DALL-E.

The key part of the prompt are words or phrases that describe the image you want. More adjectives and specific descriptive nouns create unique images. On the contrary, basic nouns or adjectives make plain images. Keep in mind, Midjourney doesn't understand grammar. So, very long prompts may not work well. When creating prompts, remove any unnecessary words. Fewer words give each word more importance, ensuring the image aligns with your theme.

For instance, "illustrate for me a beautiful sunset over a serene ocean, make the colors warm and soothing, and render it in an impressionistic style." This prompt has words that Midjourney might not understand or work with. Phrases like "Illustrate for me" are unnecessary. Verbs like "make" and "render" are also redundant. Midjourney usually accepts descriptive words like nouns and adjectives. The prompt could be simpler: "warm soothing sunset over serene ocean, impressionistic oil paint."

More specific synonyms often work better than general ones. For example, use precise words like "petite",  "compact", "diminutive" and "tiny" instead of "small". When creating your prompt, focus on specific details you want:

- **Theme:** People, animals, places, character, objects, events, etc.
- **Use Case:** Logos, web design, interior design, prototypes, product design, etc.
- **Medium:** Photos, drawings, illustrations, paintings, cartoons, watercolors, collages, sculptures, graffiti, mosaics, tapestries, pottery, etc.
- **Environment:** Indoor, outdoor, city, forest, island, desert, underwater, cave, future city, space, moon, space station, etc.
- **Lighting:** Soft, twilight, ambient, direct sunlight, overcast, moonlight, neon, candlelight, firelight, etc.
- **Color:** Vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel, etc.
- **Mood:** Energetic, sedate, calm, raucous, restless, melancholy, dreamy, mysterious, etc.
- **Composition:** Portrait, close-up, headshot, bird's eye view, symmetrical, leading lines, minimalist, silhouette, panorama, etc.
- **Artists:** Van Gogh, Picasso, Dali, Paul Cézanne, Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, Rembrandt, Hayao Miyazaki, etc.
- **Art styles:** Oriental landscape painting, Ukiyo-e, conceptual art, Bauhaus, Impressionism, Rococo, Surrealism, long exposure, etc.

You can also use a comma, plus sign, or "and" to separate different subjects. For instance, to depict a light and a house, you should separate them. Otherwise, if you type "light house," Midjourney will show you a lighthouse.

Midjourney prompts can also include parameters to change how an image generates. Common parameters include:

1. **--ar**

   This parameter sets the screen's aspect ratio. Default is 1:1; `--ar 16:9` for computer screens and `--ar 9:16` for cell phone screens.

2. **--v**

   This parameter specifies the Midjourney version. `--v 5.2` represents version 5.2.

3. **--s**

   This parameter controls the artistic level of the image, with values from 0 to 1000. A higher value indicates a more artistic image, but the image will also deviate more from the actual effect described by the prompt. Lower values indicate that the effect of the image is closer to the description of the prompt, but less artistic. The suggested setting is `--s 750`.

4. **--style**

   This parameter `--style raw` is used for photographic images.

5. **--q**

   This parameter defines the image detail. More detail is created with larger values. Default value is `--q 1`. Recommended setting is `--q 2`.

With this knowledge, we'll now explore 20 examples of prompts:
