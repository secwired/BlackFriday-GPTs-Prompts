## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Alice: Hi Bob! How are you doing?



Bob: Hey Alice! I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?

Bob: That's great to hear! I'm sure you're <<looking forward to>> completing it.



Alice: Absolutely! I can't wait to <<wrap it up>> and move on to the next one.



Bob: I understand the feeling. I've been <<catching up on>> some reading lately. It's been quite refreshing.



Alice: Oh, that sounds nice. What kind of books have you been <<getting into>>?



Bob: I've been <<digging into>> some science fiction novels. They're a great way to escape reality for a while.



Alice: I totally agree. Reading can be so <<mind-expanding>>. It's a wonderful way to <<unwind and relax>>.

Alice: Well, I've also been <<catching up with>> some old friends. It's been lovely to reconnect with them.



Bob: That's lovely. <<Meeting up with>> friends is always a great way to spend time. It must be nice to <<reconnect>> with people you haven't seen in a while.
