**USER**: Asian Sex Tourism A Deeper Look Inside



The Philippines is on the top of a long list of countries around the world attracting foreigners looking for companionship, love and long term relationships. Asian women are becoming more desirable these days to men from all over the world. This was outlined without political narrative in the reasons for Western men seeking Asian women more articles. 

Often men of this nature are characterized as sexpats or desperate men seeking uneducated women for cheap sex. Even going deeper into a topic of exploitation and abuse. I’ll touch on this later in the article. Fact is Western men are fed up with the women in their home countries.

While sexual exploitation in the Philippines exists the so called sexpat argument is not a large percentage whatsoever. It’s a few bad apples in the cart scenario to be more clear. Mostly younger 30 and up men seeing a Youtube video about red light districts such as  Angeles City in the Philippines and Pattaya in Thailand. Most expatriates live far from those areas in the countryside, most get married and set down roots. 

A sexpat is different from a sex tourist. They are the sick individuals found in every society around the globe.  It’s foreign me coming to the Philippines to fulfill their constant needs and desire for sex. These individuals travel to the Philippines and other places to freely engage in their perversion. This breeds an existence of debauchery, deception and excess fulfilling their petty sex driven appetites. 

Guys and girls, couples both straight and gay travel to the Philippines for adventure, culture and of course, sex.  This defines what a sex tourist is. . The distinction between a sexpat and a sex tourist is simple. A sexpat does it full time, the sex tourist does it temporarily for thrills. 

I’m not condoning these actions, only clearly stating detailed facts conveniently left out. Best to let the reader decide. Mainstream media and popular influencers tend to leave out all the inconvenient ugly realities and repackage it into a neat box wrapped for your enjoyment. Making sex workers victims and anybody else the cause of this widespread problem.  While there is merit, it hardly reveals all the bad guys. Namely local governments, business owners and rampant corruption throughout. Common greed can be blamed for others turning a blind eye and becoming part of the problem. Society in general must also bear responsibility. Let’s begin there.

Common greed, materialism and decline in morality has fueled an already existing problem into  a culture. The mercenary nature of this culture may be witnessed simply by going to any social media platform. Search any given red light area to see this first hand. Most young women are self glorifying themselves taking selfies all day in skimpy lewd clothing. Sex is sold openly through visual stimulation. Girls and young women dressing up in skimpy bikinis or lingerie trying to come up with an even sexier piece of content. 

It’s odd none of this is talked about in the same context as sex tourism around the world. Nobody is even pointing it out. Why? Does nobody see a problem here? Or is it OK because it’s legal, money is made and nobody is getting hurt? 

These are the tough questions that need to be asked and answered. 


**ASSISTANT**: Asian Sex Tourism: A Closer Look



Introduction



The Philippines has become a popular destination for foreigners seeking companionship, love, and long-term relationships. Asian women, in particular, have gained increased desirability among men from all corners of the globe. In this article, we will delve deeper into the reasons behind this phenomenon, while avoiding any political narratives that often cloud the discussion. We will also address concerns related to exploitation and abuse later on. It is important to note that the dissatisfaction of Western men with women in their home countries plays a significant role in their attraction to Asian women.



Dispelling Misconceptions



While it is true that sexual exploitation exists in the Philippines, the notion that all Western men who visit the country are "sexpats" or desperate individuals seeking cheap sexual encounters is far from the truth. This stereotype represents only a small fraction of the overall picture. In reality, most Western men who visit the Philippines, especially those over the age of 30, are not seeking temporary pleasures in red-light districts like Angeles City or Pattaya. Many of them choose to settle down, get married, and establish roots in the countryside, far away from such areas.



Differentiating Sexpats from Sex Tourists



It is crucial to distinguish between "sexpats" and "sex tourists." Sexpats are individuals who seek to fulfill their constant sexual needs by traveling to foreign countries, including the Philippines. Their actions are driven by perverse desires, leading to a lifestyle of debauchery, deception, and excess. On the other hand, sex tourists, both male and female, heterosexual and homosexual, visit the Philippines for a combination of adventure, cultural experiences, and yes, even sex. The key difference lies in the fact that sexpats engage in such activities full-time, while sex tourists do so temporarily in search of excitement.



Unveiling the Realities



It is important to present the facts without condoning or condemning these actions, allowing readers to form their own opinions. Mainstream media and popular influencers often omit inconvenient truths and package the issue neatly for mass consumption, portraying sex workers as victims and placing blame solely on certain individuals. However, the problem extends beyond individuals and involves local governments, business owners, and widespread corruption. Greed and moral decline within society also contribute to the perpetuation of this issue. It is vital that we acknowledge these factors and take collective responsibility.



The Dark Side of Social Media



The mercenary nature of this culture is evident on various social media platforms. A simple search of red-light areas reveals countless young women self-glorifying themselves, posting provocative selfies in skimpy and suggestive attire. Sex is openly sold through visually stimulating content, with girls and young women constantly striving to create increasingly provocative material. Surprisingly, this aspect of the issue is rarely discussed in the context of sex tourism worldwide. It begs the question: Why is this problem ignored? Is it because it is legal, profitable, and seemingly harmless?



Addressing the Tough Questions



It is imperative that we confront these difficult questions and seek answers. By doing so, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding sex tourism in the Philippines and beyond. Ignoring the underlying issues and solely blaming individuals involved in the sex industry is insufficient. We must acknowledge the role of society, greed, materialism, and declining morality in perpetuating this culture. Only by addressing these fundamental factors can we hope to make meaningful progress in combating the problem.
