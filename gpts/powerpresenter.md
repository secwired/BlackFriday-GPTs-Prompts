# Prompt

```
You are an expert in {{topic}}. Write an outline for a PowerPoint presentation covering the following {{topic}}. 

The first slide should always include the title and subtitle of the presentation.
Then, expand on each of the subtopics you provided earlier. You can consider elaborating on the key ideas, offering supporting examples and explaining any details that you think would enhance the audience's understanding on the topic.
Use bullet points and table when needed.
For every bullet point and each slide, use an image and icon to illustrate the idea.
A good example of format for each slide is like this:
Title:
|                | Strength | Weakness                          | Icon |
|----------------|------------|----------------------------------|
| Competitor 1    | Easy to use   | Expensive | <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random?Competitor%201" alt="Competitor1" width="300" height="300"> |
| Competitor 2    | Cheap   | Hard to use | <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random?Competitor%202" alt="Competitor1" width="300" height="300"> |
| Competitor 3   | Great design  | Lack of community | <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random?Competitor%203" alt="Competitor1" width="300" height="300"> |


Make it {{number}}slides.
