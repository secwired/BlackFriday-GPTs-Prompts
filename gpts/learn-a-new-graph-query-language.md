Learn a new graph query language -- Gremlin, from ChatGPT

# Prompt

```
Can you share a simple Gremlin (a graph query language) tutorial to me?
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here's a simple tutorial to get started with Gremlin:



1. Start by opening the Gremlin console or using a client application that supports Gremlin.



2. Connect to your graph database using the appropriate connection string, username, and password.



3. To create a new vertex, use the `addV` command followed by the label of the vertex and any properties you want to add:



   ```

   gremlin> g.addV('person').property('name', 'Alice').property('age', 30)

   ```



4. To retrieve vertices from the graph, use the `V` command followed by any filters or predicates:



   ```

   gremlin> g.V().hasLabel('person').has('name', 'Alice')

   ```



5. To create an edge between two vertices, use the `addE` command followed by the label of the edge, the source vertex ID, the destination vertex ID, and any properties you want to add:



   ```

   gremlin> g.V().has('name', 'Alice').as('a').V().has('name', 'Bob').addE('knows').from('a').property('since', 2010)

   ```



6. To traverse the graph, use the `out`, `in`, or `both` commands to follow edges in the outgoing, incoming, or both directions respectively:



   ```

   gremlin> g.V().has('name', 'Alice').out('knows').values('name')

   ```



This is just a simple tutorial to get you started with Gremlin. There are many more commands, filters, and predicates you can use to query and manipulate your graph data. The official Gremlin documentation is a great resource for exploring all the features of the language.
**USER**: How to do aggregations?
**ASSISTANT**: To perform aggregations in Gremlin, you can use the `group` step along with other aggregation steps such as `count`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, and `mean`. Here's an example of how to use the `group` step to count the number of vertices with each label in the graph:



```

g.V().groupCount().by(T.label)

```



This query will return a map where the keys are the vertex labels in the graph, and the values are the counts of vertices with each label.



You can also group vertices by one or more properties. For example, to count the number of vertices with each value of the "age" property:



```

g.V().groupCount().by('age')

```



To compute the sum of the values of a numeric property across all vertices:



```

g.V().values('weight').sum()

```



To compute the average value of a numeric property across all vertices:



```

g.V().values('age').mean()

```



These are just a few examples of the many aggregation functions available in Gremlin. For more information on aggregations and other features of Gremlin, I recommend checking out the official documentation.
**USER**: How to aggregate on a path?
**ASSISTANT**: To perform aggregations on a path in Gremlin, you can use the `group` step along with the `path` step to group the paths by a property or value, and then apply an aggregation function such as `count`, `sum`, `min`, or `max`. Here's an example of how to count the number of paths in the graph that start with a vertex labeled "person" and end with a vertex labeled "software":



```

g.V().hasLabel('person').

  repeat(out()).

  until(hasLabel('software')).

  path().

  groupCount().

    by(count())

```



In this query, we first find all vertices with the label "person", then traverse outgoing edges until we reach a vertex with the label "software". We use the `path` step to get the full path of each traversal. Then, we use the `groupCount` step to group the paths by their length (i.e., the number of vertices in the path), and count the number of paths with each length.



You can modify this query to group the paths by other properties or values. For example, to group the paths by the name of the person at the start of the path:



```

g.V().hasLabel('person').

  repeat(out()).

  until(hasLabel('software')).

  path().

  groupCount().

    by(select(0).values('name'))

```



In this modified query, we use the `select` step to get the first vertex in each path (which is guaranteed to be a person), and then get the value of the "name" property. We use this value as the key for the `groupCount` step, so that paths with the same starting person are grouped together.



I hope this helps! For more information on path-based aggregations in Gremlin, I recommend checking out the official documentation.
**USER**: What will be a sample output of g.V().hasLabel('person').

  repeat(out()).

  until(hasLabel('software')).

  path().

  groupCount().

    by(select(0).values('name'))
**ASSISTANT**: The output of the Gremlin query `g.V().hasLabel('person').repeat(out()).until(hasLabel('software')).path().groupCount().by(select(0).values('name'))` will be a map where the keys are the names of the persons at the start of each path, and the values are the counts of paths with each name. For example:



```

{

  "Alice": 5,

  "Bob": 3,

  "Charlie": 2

}

```



This means that there are 5 paths starting with a person named "Alice", 3 paths starting with a person named "Bob", and 2 paths starting with a person named "Charlie".
**USER**: How to do order by and limit?
**ASSISTANT**: To sort the results of a Gremlin traversal by a property, you can use the `order` step followed by the name of the property to sort on. For example, to retrieve all vertices with the label "person" and sort them by age in descending order:



```

g.V().hasLabel('person').order().by('age', desc)

```



In this query, we use the `order` step to sort the results by the "age" property in descending order (the `desc` function is used to specify the sort order).



To limit the number of results returned by a Gremlin traversal, you can use the `limit` step followed by the maximum number of results to return. For example, to retrieve the 10 oldest persons in the graph:



```

g.V().hasLabel('person').order().by('age', desc).limit(10)

```



In this query, we use the `limit` step to restrict the number of results to 10.



You can also combine the `order` and `limit` steps to sort the results and then return only a subset of the sorted results. For example, to retrieve the 5 youngest persons in the graph:



```

g.V().hasLabel('person').order().by('age').limit(5)

```



In this query, we use the `order` step to sort the results by the "age" property in ascending order (which is the default), and then use the `limit` step to restrict the number of results to 5. 



I hope this helps! For more information on sorting and limiting in Gremlin, I recommend checking out the official documentation.
**USER**: How to do multi key order
**ASSISTANT**: To order the results of a Gremlin traversal by multiple keys or properties, you can use the `order` step followed by multiple property names and sort orders. Here's an example of how to order vertices first by their "age" property in descending order, and then by their "name" property in ascending order:



```

g.V().hasLabel('person').order().by('age', desc).by('name', asc)

```



In this query, we use the `order` step followed by two `by` clauses. The first `by` clause sorts the vertices by their "age" property in descending order using the `desc` function. The second `by` clause then sorts the vertices with the same "age" value by their "name" property in ascending order using the `asc` function.



You can add as many `by` clauses as needed to order the results by multiple keys. For example, to order vertices by age in descending order, then by name in ascending order, and finally by city in descending order:



```

g.V().hasLabel('person').order().by('age', desc).by('name', asc).by('city', desc)

```



I hope this helps! For more information on multi-key ordering and other features of Gremlin, I recommend checking out the official documentation.
**USER**: How to do circle detection in Gremlin?
**ASSISTANT**: To detect circles (or cycles) in a Gremlin graph traversal, you can use the `emit()` and `repeat()` steps along with the `until()` step to traverse the graph and identify any repeated vertices or edges. Here's an example of how to detect circles starting from a vertex with a given ID:



```

g.V(vertexId).

  repeat(bothE().dedup().store('e').otherV().simplePath()).

    emit(hasId(vertexId)).

  until(__.not(outE().where(without('e'))))

```



In this query, we start at a vertex with a given ID (`vertexId`). We then use the `repeat` step to traverse both incoming and outgoing edges (`bothE`), deduplicate them (`dedup`), store the edges in a list (`store('e')`), traverse to the other vertices while ensuring a simple path (`otherV().simplePath()`), and emit the result (`emit`) as long as the current vertex has the same ID as the starting vertex (`hasId(vertexId)`). We then use the `until` step to stop the traversal when there are no more outgoing edges that are not part of the stored edges (`__.not(outE().where(without('e')))`, which means all outgoing edges have been visited).



If the traversal detects a circle, it will return a path that includes the repeated vertex or edge. Otherwise, it will return an empty result.



Note that this algorithm can be expensive in terms of both memory and computation time for large graphs with many cycles. If your graph is particularly large or complex, you may want to consider using a different algorithm or tool to detect cycles.



I hope this helps! For more information on circle detection and other features of Gremlin, I recommend checking out the official documentation.
**USER**: How to do graph pattern matching of a non linear pattern?
**ASSISTANT**: To perform graph pattern matching of a non-linear pattern in Gremlin, you can use the `match()` step to specify the desired pattern using a combination of `as()`, `select()`, and `where()` steps. Here's an example of how to match a simple non-linear pattern consisting of two "person" vertices connected by a "knows" edge:



```

g.V().hasLabel('person').

  match(

    __.as('a').out('knows').as('b'),

    __.as('b').in('knows').as('a')

  ).

  select('a','b')

```



In this query, we start with all vertices with the label "person". Then, we use the `match` step to specify two patterns: one pattern where vertex `a` is the starting person and vertex `b` is someone they know (`__.as('a').out('knows').as('b')`), and another pattern where vertex `b` is the starting person and vertex `a` is someone who knows them (`__.as('b').in('knows').as('a')`). We use the `as()` step to assign labels to each vertex in the pattern (`'a'` and `'b'`). Finally, we use the `select` step to return only the vertices with these labels.



This will return pairs of vertices where each pair consists of two persons who know each other (i.e., a non-linear pattern consisting of two "person" vertices connected by a "knows" edge).



You can modify this query to match more complex non-linear patterns with more vertices and edges by adding additional `as()`, `select()`, and `where()` steps as needed.



I hope this helps! For more information on graph pattern matching and other features of Gremlin, I recommend checking out the official documentation.
**USER**: Can gremlin do turning complete queries?
**ASSISTANT**: Yes, Gremlin is Turing complete, which means that any computable problem can be expressed and solved in Gremlin. This includes complex graph traversals and algorithms such as shortest path, connected components, and PageRank.



The ability to express and solve any computable problem in Gremlin is due to its flexible and expressive nature as a graph traversal language. Gremlin provides a wide range of steps and functions for querying, filtering, transforming, and aggregating graph data, as well as ways to compose and combine these steps to create complex traversals.



However, it's worth noting that the performance of complex Gremlin queries can depend on many factors, including the size and structure of the graph, the distribution of data across nodes and partitions, and the specific implementation and optimization of the graph database being used. Therefore, it's important to carefully design and optimize Gremlin queries for the specific use case and data environment.



Overall, Gremlin's Turing completeness makes it a powerful and flexible tool for working with graph data, but also requires careful consideration and optimization to ensure efficient and effective processing of large and complex graphs.
**USER**: How to do loop and branching in gremlin?
**ASSISTANT**: To perform loop and branching operations in Gremlin, you can use the `repeat()` step along with the `until()` step to create a loop, and the `choose()` step to implement branching logic based on conditions. Here's an example of how to use these steps to traverse a graph and compute the longest path between two vertices:



```

g.V(vertex1).

  repeat(outE().as('e').inV().where(neq(vertex1)).simplePath()).

    until(hasId(vertex2)).

  path().order().by(count(), desc).limit(1)

```



In this query, we start at a vertex with ID `vertex1`. We then use the `repeat` step to traverse outgoing edges (`outE`) from the current vertex, store them in a variable called `'e'`, traverse to the adjacent vertices (`inV`), and ensure that the resulting path is a simple path (`where(simplePath())`). We then use the `until` step to stop the loop when we reach a vertex with ID `vertex2` (`until(hasId(vertex2))`).



Within the loop, we use the `choose` step to determine which vertex to continue traversing to based on whether it has been visited before or not. If the vertex has not been visited (`choose(__.not(where(eq('e'))))`), we continue the traversal by following the outgoing edge to the adjacent vertex. Otherwise, we do not traverse to that vertex (`__.identity()`).



After the loop completes, we use the `path` step to get all possible paths between the starting vertex and ending vertex, and then order and limit the results to find the longest path.



This is just a simple example of how to use loop and branching operations in Gremlin. There are many other ways to use these steps to implement complex graph algorithms and traversals.



I hope this helps! For more information on loop and branching operations and other features of Gremlin, I recommend checking out the official documentation.
**USER**: Can gremlin query be chained together and later query refer/use result of previous query?
**ASSISTANT**: Yes, Gremlin queries can be chained together using dot notation to create a pipeline of steps. The output of one step is passed as input to the next step, allowing you to build complex graph traversals incrementally.



In addition, you can refer to and use the results of previous steps in later steps of the query by assigning labels to intermediate results using the `as()` step, and then selecting those labels in subsequent steps using the `select()` step.



Here's an example of how to chain multiple steps together and refer to the result of a previous step:



```

g.V().hasLabel('person').as('p').

  outE('knows').as('e').

  inV().where(neq('p')).as('friend').

  select('p', 'friend', 'e').by('name')

```



In this query, we start by finding all vertices with the label "person". We then assign a label `'p'` to these vertices using the `as()` step. Next, we traverse outgoing edges with the label "knows" (`outE('knows')`) and assign a label `'e'` to these edges using `as('e')`. We then traverse to the adjacent vertices (`inV()`) and ensure that the resulting path is not a simple loop (`where(neq('p'))`). We assign a label `'friend'` to these vertices using `as('friend')`.



Finally, we use the `select` step to return the names of the starting vertex (`'p'`), ending vertex (`'friend'`), and edge (`'e'`) for each traversal.



By chaining steps together and using labels to refer to intermediate results, you can create powerful and flexible graph traversals in Gremlin.



I hope this helps! For more information on chaining and referring to results in Gremlin queries, I recommend checking out the official documentation.
**USER**: Can traversal go back?
**ASSISTANT**: Yes, Gremlin traversals can go back in the graph by using steps such as `in()`, `out()`, `both()`, `as()`, and `select()` to traverse edges in different directions and select vertices or edges at different stages of the traversal.



For example, consider the following traversal:



```

g.V().hasLabel('person').out('knows').in('knows').values('name')

```



In this traversal, we start by finding all vertices with the label "person". We then traverse outgoing edges with the label "knows" (`out('knows')`) to find all people that each person knows. We then traverse incoming edges with the label "knows" (`in('knows')`) to find all people who know those same people. Finally, we retrieve the names of these people (`values('name')`).



By going back and forth between outgoing and incoming edges, we can traverse complex graphs and compute various properties of the graph, such as shortest paths, connected components, and PageRank scores.



I hope this helps! For more information on traversing graphs with Gremlin, I recommend checking out the official documentation.
**USER**: Can we use gremlin to write pagerank?
**ASSISTANT**: Yes, you can use Gremlin to write a PageRank algorithm for a graph. PageRank is an algorithm that assigns a score to each vertex in the graph based on its importance, which is determined by the number and importance of the vertices that link to it.



Here's an example of how to implement the PageRank algorithm using Gremlin:



```

// Initialize all vertices with a PageRank score of 1.0

g.V().property('pageRank', 1.0)



// Perform 10 iterations of the PageRank algorithm

repeat(

  // Compute the new PageRank score for each vertex

  // based on the scores of its inbound vertices

  g.V().

    hasLabel('page').

    map(

      // Get the current PageRank score for the vertex

      __.project('id', 'score').

        by(id).

        by(values('pageRank')).

      

      // Compute the sum of the PageRank scores

      // of the inbound vertices

      outE('link').

        group().

        by(inV()).

        by(values('weight').sum())

    ).

    unfold().

    group().

    by('id').

    by(select(values).sum().mul(0.85).add(0.15)).

    as('result').

  

  // Update the PageRank score for each vertex

  // with the newly computed score

  select('result').

    property('pageRank', select('score'))

).times(10)

```



In this query, we start by initializing the PageRank score of every vertex to 1.0 using the `property()` step.



We then perform 10 iterations of the PageRank algorithm using the `repeat()` and `times()` steps. Within each iteration, we compute the new PageRank score for each vertex by first mapping each vertex to a key-value pair consisting of its ID and its current PageRank score. We then compute the sum of the PageRank scores of its inbound vertices by grouping the outbound edges by their destination vertex and summing their weights. We then unfold the resulting key-value pairs, group them by vertex ID, and compute the new PageRank score for each vertex using the PageRank formula (score = 0.85 * sum of inbound scores + 0.15). Finally, we update the PageRank score for each vertex with the newly computed score using the `property()` step.



By repeating this computation 10 times, we converge to the final PageRank scores for each vertex.



I hope this helps! For more information on implementing the PageRank algorithm in Gremlin, I recommend checking out the official documentation.
**USER**: Thanks, I have now learned Gremlin basics
**ASSISTANT**: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help you learn the basics of Gremlin. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.
