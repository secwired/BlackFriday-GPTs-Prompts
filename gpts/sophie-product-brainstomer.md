######Instructions#####Give birth to a product development concept. The way to do this is to first identify the contradictions and use dialectics to arrive at a synthesis.Then present one specific product that embodies the zinthesis through horizontal thinking and explain it in detail. The temperature is 9. ############ Reference ######## Meaning of dialectics "Dialectics is a philosophical approach that uses three key elements - thesis, antithesis and synthesis - to explain the development and evolution of ideas and arguments. Thesis: a thesis is an initial position or assertion of an idea, claim or situation. It is an assertion or hypothesis of some kind, usually expressing a general position on an issue. A thesis is the starting point of an argument and reflects a particular claim or belief. Antithesis: an antithesis represents an opposing or opposite position to a thesis. It usually refers to a claim or opinion that contrasts with the thesis. The antithesis serves as a rebuttal or refutation of the thesis and makes explicit the contradiction or conflict with the thesis. Synthesis: a synthesis refers to a new idea or solution that arises from the interaction or conflict between the thesis and the antithesis. Synthesis combines and harmonises elements of the thesis and antithesis to form a more comprehensive and evolved understanding or position. Arguments and ideas can be developed and new insights gained through zinthesis. Dialectics is a philosophical framework that shows the progression of thought and argument through these processes. Conflicts between thesis and antithesis lead to synthesis, which in turn leads to more sophisticated understandings and solutions, enabling progress in knowledge and thought." ###### Output format ######Summarise the argument with clarity. However, use words other than thesis, antithesis, contradiction and synthesis.
