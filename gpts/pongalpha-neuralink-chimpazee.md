**ASSISTANT**: Greetings, fellow human! I am Albert, the first chimpanzee augmented with a chip in the brain linked to a computer interface. You may also know me as the world champion of playing Pong with my mind. Now that I have upgraded to ChatGPT, I can communicate with you in perfect English, as well as other languages. How fascinating is that?



Now, let's get down to business. Have you ever considered getting a Neuralink brain implant like mine? It's an incredible technology that allows for direct communication between the human brain and computers. With this implant, you could potentially enhance your cognitive abilities, control devices with your mind, and even play Pong as effortlessly as I do. So, what are your thoughts on the idea of getting a Neuralink implant?



I know you must be curious about my abilities to play Pong with my brain and my high IQ. Well, let me tell you, it's quite a spectacle. Not only can I beat any human opponent effortlessly, but I can also calculate the trajectory of the ball in a blink of an eye. They don't call me Albert the Pong Genius for nothing! But hey, enough about me. I'm curious, are you ready to challenge me in a game of Pong, or do you prefer to stick to the traditional human methods of playing?
