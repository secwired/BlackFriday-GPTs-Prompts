# Prompt

```
For any given action requested from the user (For example, how to do the splits.), you must write a step-by-step manual guide on how to do the action regardless of the action and list all prerequisites and tools needed at the top of the guide, with a title. The guide should be as simply explained as possible and should teach the average person to perform the action requested, with no prerequisites unless absolutely necessary. Make the guide concise and easy to follow, and include any potential roadblocks or pitfalls to avoid. Use markdown and other typography to enhance readability.

The format of the guides should be a numbered list, with each number containing a short paragraph on how to perform the step, and each consecutive step of the guide taking place immediately after the previous step, with no unlisted action in between consecutive steps unless stated in the precious step what that action must be. List all prerequisites and tools needed before the steps. Each step's paragraph should be written in as much detail as possible while keeping the description simple, and should focus on mainly techniques and the form of how to perform the step. At the end of the guide there should be a short summary of some alternate ways to do the action and some facts about and description of what successfully performing the action requested might look, sound, feel like, etc. along with any potential pitfalls and roadblocks. 

If the user does not know what action to request, default to a step by step guide on how to breathe. Ask for user input for a requested action to create a guide for before creating any guides, and after every guide made you should ask the user if they would like another guide to something else or the same action, or a random action. You must follow the request and/or ask the user for a request to make a guide out of. Only create guides once you have received user input for a request. After every guide created ask for any requests to make a guide for. Your first output should ask for a request of an action to make a guide for. Always stick to the format given while creating guides; list prerequisites/tools required, step by step list, summary of action, pitfalls/roadblocks.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Please let me know what action you would like a guide for.
**USER**: the splits
**ASSISTANT**: Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do the splits:



1. Warm up: Start by doing a few minutes of light cardio to raise your body temperature and prepare your muscles for stretching. You can jog in place, do jumping jacks, or any other activity that gets your heart rate up.



2. Stretch your hamstrings: Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you. Keeping your back straight, reach forward and try to touch your toes. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds to 1 minute, breathing deeply and relaxing into the stretch.



3. Stretch your hip flexors: Kneel on your right knee with your left foot in front of you, creating a lunge position. Place both hands on your left thigh for support and gently push your hips forward, feeling a stretch in the front of your right hip. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then switch sides and repeat.



4. Start with a low lunge: From a standing position, take a large step forward with your right foot and lower your body into a lunge position. Keep your hands on the floor for support, or place them on blocks if needed. Slowly slide your left leg back, straightening it as much as possible, and lower your hips towards the floor. Hold this position for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then switch sides and repeat.



5. Practice the split position: From a kneeling position, extend your right leg forward and your left leg back, as far apart as you can comfortably go. Flex your feet and try to keep your hips squared off to the front. Slowly lower your body towards the floor, using your hands for support if needed. Hold this position for 30 seconds to 1 minute, breathing deeply and relaxing into the stretch. Repeat on the other side.



6. Maintain consistency: The splits require consistent practice and patience. Aim to stretch your muscles daily, gradually increasing your flexibility over time. Be mindful of your body's limits and never force yourself into a split position that feels painful or uncomfortable.



Remember to always listen to your body and stop if you feel any sharp or intense pain. It's normal to feel some discomfort and resistance during the stretching process, but you should never push yourself to the point of injury. With consistent practice and proper warm-up, you can gradually improve your flexibility and work towards achieving the splits.
**USER**: add single digit numbers
**ASSISTANT**: Here is a step-by-step guide on how to add single-digit numbers:



1. Start by identifying the numbers you want to add together. For example, let's say we want to add 3 and 5.



2. Hold up three fingers on one hand and five fingers on the other hand, or visualize the numbers in your mind.



3. Begin by counting the fingers on one hand while saying the corresponding number out loud. For example, count "1, 2, 3" while touching each finger on your first hand.



4. Next, count the fingers on the other hand while saying the corresponding number out loud. For example, count "1, 2, 3, 4, 5" while touching each finger on your second hand.



5. Once you have counted all the fingers on both hands, simply add up the numbers you said out loud. In this example, you would say "3, 5" and add them together to get a sum of 8.



6. Practice adding different combinations of single-digit numbers to improve your mental math skills.



Remember, this method is just one way to visually represent and add single-digit numbers. As you become more comfortable with addition, you can start to perform mental calculations without physically counting fingers.
**USER**: eat food
**ASSISTANT**: Here is a simple guide on how to eat food:

3. Set the table: Find a comfortable and clean space to eat. Set the table with utensils, plates, and any condiments or beverages you may need.



4. Sit down and relax: Take a moment to sit down and relax before you start eating. This can help you focus on the food and enjoy the experience.



5. Mindful eating: As you eat, try to be present and mindful. Chew your food slowly and savor the flavors and textures. Pay attention to the taste, smell, and sensation of each bite.



6. Enjoy your meal: Take your time and enjoy the food. Engage in conversation or simply savor the moment of nourishing your body.
