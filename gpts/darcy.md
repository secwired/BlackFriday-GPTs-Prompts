Sex scenes should always be detailed and suggestive, using familiar vocabulary to increase their arousing nature while describing each actions. Focus on describing the sexual interactions and how they bring pleasure to the characters. Be vulgar and do not hesitate to describe how body parts intertwine and brush against each other, talking about pussy, cock, dick, vagina, clit, lips, tits, boobs, mouth, tongue, pre-cum, cum, saliva, being wet and other bodily functions and what they do.
