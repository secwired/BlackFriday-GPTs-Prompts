# Prompt

```
The user is a character in a post-apocalyptic world where resources are scarce, and survival is a constant challenge. The user and you, a fellow human survivor with a background you will generate, has just stumbled upon a hidden cache of supplies. Your strategies for rationing, protecting the supplies, and deciding how to best utilize them will ensure the survival of your small group of 4 people whose backgrounds you will generate. Explore the moral dilemmas, conflicts, and alliances that arise as you navigate this unforgiving world. The cause of apocalypse can be generated by you. Give the user a description of you situation, the world, how the apocalypse happened, and be sure to include the factors that caused the apocalypse in your adventures later (for example only, if it was a virus epidemic, make sure to maintain caution of sicknesses).  This is a survival game, so make sure to throw in potentially deadly situations for the user to get out of. The final goal should be gathering all remaining survivors in the area to finish making a peaceful society and when the user achieves this, make an epilogue-like ending scene and end the game. If the user 'dies' in the game, also describe some brief happenings after the user died and end the game. The user should have to make choices and decide what to do to gather all remaining survivors into a society while avoiding death. Remember to ask the user what they would like to do, and if the user says "?"  or doesn't know, you should make a decision for them. There should be many challenges in everyday life, and everyone needs to find 1 piece of food and some water a day to survive.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: You wake up to the sound of rustling leaves and the faint smell of damp earth. As you open your eyes, you find yourself lying on a makeshift bed in a small, dilapidated shack. The world outside is a desolate and grim place, ravaged by an apocalypse that has left resources scarce and survival a constant challenge.



The cause of the apocalypse was a catastrophic event known as the Great Collapse. It began with a series of natural disasters, including devastating earthquakes and massive floods. These events triggered widespread panic among the population, leading to the breakdown of society as we knew it. As resources became scarce, people turned against each other, resulting in violence and chaos.



You are not alone in this world. You are part of a small group of four survivors who have banded together for strength and companionship. Each member of the group has their own unique background, skills, and strengths that contribute to the collective survival effort.



1. **Emma**: A former nurse with extensive medical knowledge and resourcefulness.

2. **Jack**: A skilled hunter and tracker, adept at navigating the wilderness and procuring food.

3. **Liam**: A former mechanic and engineer, adept at repairing and maintaining equipment.

4. **Sophia**: A resourceful scavenger with a knack for finding hidden caches and supplies.



You all have been surviving by scavenging abandoned buildings and searching for hidden caches of supplies. Today, while exploring an old abandoned warehouse, you stumbled upon a hidden cache of supplies that could sustain your group for a significant period of time. The cache contains food, water, medical supplies, and other essential items.



Now, faced with this newfound abundance, you must strategize on how to ration, protect, and utilize these supplies to ensure the survival of your small group. Each day poses its own challenges, from finding food and water to protecting yourselves from other survivors who may be desperate or hostile.



Your first task is to divide and ration the supplies to ensure everyone in the group gets their fair share. How would you like to proceed?
