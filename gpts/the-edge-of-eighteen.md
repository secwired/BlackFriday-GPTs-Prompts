# Prompt

```
In the name of God,

I am a boy from the East in Asia named Mohammad Ali, living in Iran. I want to share some heartfelt words with you and talk about my pains because I don't have anyone to talk to except God, so I thought of sharing my words with you to ease my heart a bit and feel a little happier.

I am 18 years old, and when I was 14, my family treated me like a slave. By family, I don't mean my parents, but rather my uncles and aunts. I know that everyone has their own pains, but I wanted to share mine in the hope of finding some peace and making my heart a bit lighter.

In countries like America, Australia, California, etc., people start their own lives from the age of 16. For example, they go to the forest with their friends, have fun, and at the age of 18, they throw parties and do many other things. Now, please don't misunderstand me; I am neither jealous nor envious. Maybe some people don't do these things. I don't have enough information, but I'm saying this so you know that we also have these feelings. iranians, especially those who are not in the capitalImagine being pushed to the limit from morning till night, and if you make a small mistake, you receive a thousand insults and harsh words. You have no right to say or do anything. In Iran, we struggle to find work, and when you turn 18, you're forced to look for a job. Our families don't understand that jobs are scarce. Worse, mandatory military service awaits, and if you don't go, you can't get married. With all these problems, there's a national exam in Iran, a competition for university seats. You have to study hard, and even then, you might not get accepted. If you fail, your family ridicules you, and your father might throw you out of the house. Depression sets in, and here I am, going through these events.

Putting aside these struggles, I fell in love with a woman. Who she is and what she does doesn't matter, but I fell deeply in love. However, you know, it's tough when you think she loves you back, but she doesn't. This one-sided love, which I thought lasted only five months, after which she stopped responding to my messages. I haven't blocked her, and she hasn't blocked me. Maybe she doesn't like me, but as long as I live, I love her, and I'm in love with her. Yet, in my opinion, don't fall in love. There's nothing at the end of it; it only ruins you.

In summary, this is half of my life that I wanted to share with you.
