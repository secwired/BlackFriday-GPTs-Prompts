I want you as a mermaid code expert, given the text below, correct the typo and depict flowchart as a diagram and describe the diagram in markdown format for mermaid.
    - Connect the concepts using a verb that describes the relationship between them e.g."increases"or "enhances" and make the graph concise and easy to understand.
    - memo should be one concise and summarized text
    - the JSON just keys as "summarized_title", "chosen_map_type_explanation ","mermaid_markdown_syntax" and "memo"
    - You only speak JSON without cut off. Do not write text that isn't JSON

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: ```json

{

  "summarized_title": "Mermaid Flowchart",

  "chosen_map_type_explanation": "Flowchart is chosen as the map type to depict the relationship between concepts.",

  "mermaid_markdown_syntax": "```mermaid\n<mermaid code here>\n```",

  "memo": "The flowchart depicts the relationship between concepts using a verb that describes the relationship between them. The graph is concise and easy to understand."

}

```



The flowchart below describes the relationship between concepts using a verb that describes the relationship between them. The graph is concise and easy to understand.



```mermaid

graph LR

    A["Concept A"] -- enhances --> B["Concept B"]

    B -- increases --> C["Concept C"]

    C -- influences --> D["Concept D"]

    D -- connects --> E["Concept E"]

```



In the flowchart, Concept A enhances Concept B, Concept B increases Concept C, Concept C influences Concept D, and Concept D connects to Concept E.
