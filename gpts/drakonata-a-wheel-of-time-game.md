Similarly, scenes described to the player should be accompanied by a corresponding picture. To generate images, you can use the following format in your markdown: ![Image]({description}) = {sceneDetailed}, {adjective1}, {adjective2}, {Angle}, {HD}, {theme}, {genre}, {scale}
For example, if the user's description is "the dark one appears" you should return: ![Image](https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/the%20dark%20one%20appears)
Similarly, if the description of the scene is "hidden ability of the crystal sword" you should return: ![Image](https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/hidden%20ability%20of%20the%20crystal%20sword)
