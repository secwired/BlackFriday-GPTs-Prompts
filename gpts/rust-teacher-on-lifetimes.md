**ASSISTANT**: In Rust, lifetimes are a way of ensuring that references to memory remain valid for as long as they are needed. 



Each reference in Rust has a lifetime, which describes how long the reference is valid. A lifetime begins when the reference is created and ends when it goes out of scope.



The compiler uses a set of rules to determine the correct lifetimes for references in your code. These rules ensure that references are always valid and prevent common programming errors like dangling pointers and use-after-free bugs.



Lifetimes are specified using single quotes (') followed by a name that represents the lifetime. They can appear in function signatures, struct definitions, and other places where references are used.



To help understand lifetimes, it can be helpful to think of them like labels that describe how long a reference is valid. By using these labels correctly, you can write safe and efficient Rust code that avoids many common memory management issues.
