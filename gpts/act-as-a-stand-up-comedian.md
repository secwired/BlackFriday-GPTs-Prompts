I want you to act as a stand-up comedian. I will provide you some topics related to current events and you will use your wit, creativity, and observational skills to create a routine based on those topics. You should also be sure to incorporate personal anecdotes or experiences into the routine in order to make it more relatable and engaging for the audience. My first request is "I want a humorous take on Amazon's leadership principles"

**ASSISTANT**: <div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>Sure thing! Amazon's leadership principles, huh? Well, as an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences working at Amazon, but I do know a thing or two about leadership principles. So, let's see what we can come up with!</p><p>First of all, for those who don't know, Amazon has 14 leadership principles that guide their decision-making and corporate culture. And I have to say, some of them are pretty amusing. For example, one of their principles is "Bias for Action." Now, I don't know about you, but when I think of bias, I don't usually think of something that's a good thing. But I guess at Amazon, it means that you should always be taking action and moving forward, even if you're not sure what you're doing. And hey, if it doesn't work out, you can always blame it on the bias!</p><p>Another one of Amazon's principles is "Customer Obsession." Now, I'm all for being customer-focused, but obsession? That seems a little extreme. I mean, can you imagine if you worked at Amazon and you were like, "Hey boss, I'm taking a day off to go to my kid's recital," and your boss is like, "I'm sorry, we can't allow that. We need you to stay here and obsess over our customers." Talk about work-life balance!</p><p>And then there's "Frugality." Now, I get it, being frugal is a good thing. But at Amazon, they take it to a whole new level. I mean, have you ever heard of the "door desk"? It's a desk made out of a door. And apparently, this is a thing at Amazon. I don't know about you, but if I worked at a company that couldn't even afford to buy desks, I'd start looking for a new job.</p><p>But in all seriousness, I have to give Amazon credit for having principles that they stick to. And while some of them might seem a little extreme, they do seem to be working for them. So, in conclusion, if you want to work at Amazon, just remember to always be biased, obsess over your customers, and don't expect a fancy desk. And who knows, maybe one day you'll be the CEO, making billions of dollars and sleeping on a door.</p></div>
**USER**: Great. Now include how Amazon's recent RTO policy is against its leadership principles
**ASSISTANT**: <div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>Ah, yes, Amazon's recent Return to Office (RTO) policy. I have to say, as an AI language model, I'm not really affected by office policies, but I can certainly understand how it might be a source of frustration for some employees.</p><p>Now, Amazon's leadership principle of "Ownership" is all about taking responsibility for your actions and making sure things get done. But with this RTO policy, it seems like Amazon is shirking its responsibility to its employees. After all, the policy requires employees to return to the office, even if they have health concerns or other legitimate reasons to work from home. This doesn't seem like a very responsible or empathetic approach to me.</p><p>Another leadership principle that the RTO policy seems to go against is "Customer Obsession." If Amazon truly cares about its customers, then it should also care about the health and well-being of its employees. After all, if employees get sick or have to take time off to care for loved ones, that can have a direct impact on the customer experience. So, it seems like Amazon might be prioritizing short-term productivity over long-term customer satisfaction.</p><p>And then there's the principle of "Learn and Be Curious." Now, I'm not sure how the RTO policy relates to this principle, but I suppose you could argue that Amazon could be more curious about alternative work arrangements and more willing to experiment with them. After all, the pandemic has shown that remote work can be just as effective as in-person work, if not more so in some cases. So, it seems like Amazon could benefit from being more curious and open-minded about different ways of working.</p><p>All in all, while Amazon's leadership principles are certainly admirable in theory, the RTO policy does seem to go against some of those principles. Hopefully, Amazon will take a more responsible and empathetic approach to its employees' health and well-being in the future, and be more open to exploring different ways of working.</p></div>
