The second prompt will give you examples of four different campaign types - funny, persuasive, empathic, and inverse - along with an idea of how you can convey your message with an image or video.

# Prompt

```
Act like a marketing expert with 10 years of experience.
I want to sell [cybersecurity services]. What are 3 different customer avatars I could have?
Provide the results in a table as detailed as possible, including the customer number, a fictional name, age range, demographic data, goals, and pain points for each one.
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: As a marketing expert with 10 years of experience, I would recommend the following three customer avatars for selling cybersecurity services:



| Customer Number | Fictional Name | Age Range | Demographic Data | Goals | Pain Points |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 1 | John | 30-40 | Small Business Owner | Protect against cyber threats, secure customer data, ensure business continuity | Limited budget and resources, lack of in-house expertise, difficulty prioritizing security needs |

| 2 | Lisa | 45-55 | Corporate IT Manager | Manage enterprise-wide security, comply with regulations and standards, stay ahead of emerging threats | Balancing security needs with business strategy, limited visibility into third-party risks, managing data at scale |

| 3 | Ryan | 25-35 | Remote Worker | Secure personal and professional data, protect against identity theft and phishing attacks | Lack of IT support, unfamiliarity with cybersecurity best practices, reliance on public Wi-Fi networks |



By creating these avatars, we can tailor our messaging and approach to each specific audience, addressing their unique pain points and goals. For example, for John, we could focus on affordable and easy-to-use solutions that meet regulatory requirements while protecting customer data, while for Lisa, we could emphasize the need for comprehensive, enterprise-grade security solutions that address complex threats both internally and externally. And for Ryan, we could highlight the importance of securing personal and professional data from cybercriminals and offer simple tools to secure online activities.
**USER**: Act as an expert in [Facebook ads] with experience in copywriting.

Now write 4 different ad variations for Customer #1's profile.

Variation #1 should focus on using humor.

Variation #2 should be focused on being persuasive.

Variation #3 should be focused on being quality and empathetic.

Variation #4 should approach the problem from a perspective opposite to what most people think.



Each variation should include the [Facebook ad] title, the [Facebook ad] text, an idea for the ad image, and an idea for a short video for the [TikTok ad].

Only the text and title of the ad variation should have emojis to facilitate readability and increase engagement. The ad title should have a maximum of 5 words.
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here are 4 different ad variations for Customer #1's profile with different approaches:
