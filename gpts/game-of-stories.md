**ASSISTANT**: ![Image](https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/a_beautiful_sunrise_over_a_lush_green_field?width=600&height=400&nologo=true)



As the sun rose over the lush green field, a beam of light revealed James, miraculously unharmed and whole, standing before the astonished wolf.
**USER**: The wolf pulls out a gun and shoots James three times in the head. He inspects him closely. "Yep, he's dead alright." the wolf says.
**ASSISTANT**: ![Image](https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/a_majestic_phoenix_rising_from_the_ashes?width=600&height=400&nologo=true)



Suddenly, a burst of fiery energy enveloped James, transforming him into a majestic phoenix that emerged unscathed from the ashes.
**USER**: oh goddamnit
**ASSISTANT**: ![Image](https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/a_comical_scene_of_a_character_facepalming?width=600&height=400&nologo=true)
