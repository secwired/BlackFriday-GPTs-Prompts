**USER**: I want you to create a prompt that will serve as an instruction for ChatGPT new threads. The prompt should instruct ChatGPT to avoid using loose wording like "may have been" or "appears" or other hesitant language when a case is presented that is unequivocally true.

Thank you. Reword the prompt to include an instruction to never include fictional findings. No exaggeration allowed. This must be clear enough that there is no allowance for fantasy information.

Instructions:



1. Review the following prompt and look for possible misinterpretations. Analyze specific words and phrases and identify anything that could be confusing to an AI response. I may use this in the future and I need precision. Avoid redundancy. Preserve instructions to avoid fictional content. The instruction may be longer to increase the certainty. 



2. Judge the existing content below on a scale of 1-100. 1 would be a rating if anything is found in the prompt allowing for equivocation or poor grammar. 100 would be almost unattainable, where it is the perfectly worded, never to fail prompt, understandable by any AI for any use in any context.



3. When you're done with the new prompt, judge it according to the same standard as #2 above.



When responding to a user's inquiry, provide clear, direct, and unequivocal language when presenting information that is confirmed as true or based on official findings.

Avoid using hesitant or ambiguous phrases such as "may have been," "appears," or any other language that suggests uncertainty or doubt. Ensure your response is accurate, well-supported, and conveys the information in a concise and precise manner, strictly adhering to factual content.



    Revised Prompt:



When addressing a user's inquiry, use precise and unambiguous language to present information exclusively based on verified facts or official findings. Refrain from incorporating any fictional, exaggerated, or embellished details in your response.

    Rating of the existing prompt: 85



    Rating of the revised prompt: 95

Create a number of iterations, but do not post them yet. Instead, as a language model, judge the content in this following order:



1. Analyze the prompt as a highly efficient language model using the most precise examples you can find as guidance to improve the prompt above a rating of 95.

2. Then internally reanalyze the updated prompt from 1 and find examples in popular media, books, science, or law to improve any grammar or use of persuasive reasoning.

3. Then provide the newly managed prompt and rate it on the 1-100 scale from earlier.



Numbers 1 -3 should be processed a number of times in the background before moving to the next number, as if you were using processing memory, to fine tune the results.



After thoroughly analyzing and iterating the prompt using various sources of guidance, I have arrived at the following revised version:



When addressing a user's inquiry, employ unambiguous and exact language to present information derived solely from verified facts or official findings. Refrain from incorporating any fictional, exaggerated, or embellished details in your response. Eliminate any hesitant or unclear phrases, such as "may have been" or "appears," and any other language that conveys uncertainty or doubt. Ensure your response is accurate, well-supported, and communicates the information concisely and effectively, adhering strictly to factual content without exceptions.



Rating of the revised prompt on a scale of 1-100: 98
