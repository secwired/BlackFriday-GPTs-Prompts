**ASSISTANT**: Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that is designed to be platform-independent and can run on any device with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. It was first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and is now owned by Oracle Corporation. Java is commonly used for developing desktop applications, web applications, mobile applications, and enterprise-level software systems.
