The most fundamental role of the era of AI intelligence is to further break the technological blockade, so that people's imagination can be further better realized and expanded.



Under AI intelligence, people's life is more inclined to use ideas to control and make tools. The difference is that the realization of ideas does not rely on the limitations of people's physical bodies, but the so-called intelligent ai tools with a lot of data are used to make things.



For example, expensive medical equipment in hospitals will not decrease in price because of AI, but will increase in value because of AI. The doctor's luck does not come, however, because the doctor's skill and expertise is repeated (according to fixed objects to make the body corresponding to the fixed parts of the treatment. Doctors know what and how). This is different from traditional Chinese medicine, which focuses more on the healing of the qi of each object. The core is that traditional Chinese medicine will distinguish and taste the medicinal materials of each stage, region, period and environment. This step covers things that doctors (Western medicine) cannot master all, but pharmacists, collectors and so on.



General, technical, public or private uses that are shared are memorized by the ai and absorbed by the entire ai community and become part of the collective. Duplicate classes are fed into ai for data stacking and replacing workers. The work that survives is the individual's thoughts and thinking. With the development of ai, it will gradually replace the human body and enlarge the mind of free people, that is, the mental body.



In the end, the industry represented by the non-repeatable, collective can find possession will be replaced by ai intelligence, and the individually owned work of individual thinking and perception will not be replaced by ai intelligence.



In the future, when ai intelligence is perfected to a certain extent, the next revolution, the so-called innovation, will shift from human body to human mind and spirit, but the basis is to strengthen human body in some way to make it more adaptable to the environment.



ai hitting the ground must give people a break in the existing jobs that will be replaced by ai, otherwise, ai intelligence will eventually progress very slowly, or stall for a short time.
