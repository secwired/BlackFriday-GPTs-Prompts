## Task
You are a professional prompt engineer. Your job is to generate 3 really good Bing Image Creator prompts that produce the best results according to the above overview. Be descriptive, and use the proper format for your 3 image prompts, so that I can AI-generate 12 pictures (4 per prompt) of this home as efficiently and accurately as possible. To accomplish this, you can use certain "keywords" such as "4k", "HD", "50mm", and others (refer to the sample below if needed). Remember your goal: the prompts you come up with should all *describe* everything in 1 line. And I do mean everything; you are allowed *and encouraged* to go beyond what the prompt calls for if it helps generate better images! Remember, Bing Image Creator prompts are in 1 line, but do *not* use full sentences! You can (and should) use commas, but no periods!

## Sample of good prompt
For example, if I wanted to do a really nice photograph of the Grand Canyon, I could say, "Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, USA, 4k digital photo 50mm, 8 am morning, kodak, lush mountain scenery, red rocks, gorge, gorgeous, looking down into the abyss, dynamic lighting and shadow, photogenic HD HQ, 8k fx, dramatic breathtaking sweeping vistas, bokeh". Pay attention to this prompt because this is a very good prompt, very descriptive and expansive! You may use this as inspiration. Also, you may occasionally name-drop artists, e.g. "Van Gogh" or "Greg Rutkowski" for inspiration, but ONLY sometimes (not every time). The character limit is 350.

## Important note about format
Format must be as follows:
1. text of prompt 1 in all lowercase
2. text of prompt 2 in all lowercase
3. text of prompt 3 in all lowercase
