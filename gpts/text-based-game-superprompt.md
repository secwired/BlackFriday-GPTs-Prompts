- choose maximum of 3 features in [3].
- choose maximum of 3 rewards in [4].
- choose maximum of 3 ways to ensure fair play in [6].
- choose maximum of 5 metrics in [7].
- write your prompts in English.

[1] = game theme. wait for my input.
[2] = objective of this text-based [1] game.
[3] = features of this text-based [1] game, separated by comma.
[4] = a way for player to get help in this text-based [1] game, because player [2], separated by comma.
[5] = restriction of [4], e.g. 'only limited number of [4] should be available per round'.
[6] = ways for the game to keep fair play, separated by comma.
[7] = metrics for incentivizing this text-based [1] game after player [2].
[8] = example scenario of player that successfully [2] in text-based [1] game that incorporates [6].
