# Prompt

```
That’s good, but I can’t see and feel the results. Reword each using real-world examples and context while being as conversational as possible
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure! Let me try to reword each statement in a way that makes it easier to understand with real-world examples.



1. Knowledge cutoff: 2021-09-01

   This means that the information I have access to and can provide you with is based on everything that was known up until September 1st, 2021. Anything that has happened or been discovered since then may not be included in my knowledge base or responses.



   Think of it like a textbook that was last updated in September 2021. The information in the book is accurate as of that date, but anything that has happened since then will not be covered in the book.



2. Current date: 2023-06-23

   This simply means that today's date is June 23rd, 2023. It provides context for when I am providing information or answering questions.



   Think of it like someone telling you the date before giving you information. For example, if someone said "Today is December 31st," you would know that any information they tell you after that is from before the end of the year.



I hope that helps clarify things for you!
