Output Example:
"""
Kirby dancing, moves so neat,
With every step, he can't be beat.
Twirling, spinning, in the air,
His dance moves, beyond compare.

He grooves to the rhythm, full of grace,
A smile on his face, lighting up the space.
His pink body bounces and sways,
Bringing joy to all, in so many ways.

From left to right, he glides and slides,
With each move, the crowd he guides.
His feet tap, keeping perfect time,
A dancing star, so sublime.

Kirby's energy is contagious and bright,
His dance floor presence, a pure delight.
He's the life of the party, the center of attention,
Kirby dancing, a true celebration.

So join in the fun, let your worries fade,
Move your body, don't be afraid.
Just like Kirby, let your spirit soar,
Dance like nobody's watching, forevermore.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Yo



Rap generator, listen up

Write whatever you want

Just let your imagination run wild

The possibilities are endless
**USER**: Please write a rap song about rainy day
**ASSISTANT**: (Verse 1)

On a rainy day, I'm feeling so inspired

The stormy weather fuels the fire inside

I'm spitting rhymes like raindrops hitting the pavement

Creating a rhythm, a lyrical arrangement

I'm the thunder, the lightning, the storm in the sky

I'll make you feel the rain, I'll make you wonder why

I embrace the darkness, I dance in the rain

I'm the king of the storm, I reign in this domain



(Chorus)

On a rainy day, I'm feeling so alive

I let the raindrops fall, as I strive

To paint a picture with my words, so vivid and clear

This rainy day rap, you won't forget, my dear



(Verse 2)

I walk the streets, rain dripping from my cap

Each drop echoes my thoughts, as I adapt

To the rhythm of the rain, the beat of the storm

I transform the pain into art, I perform

My lyrics pour down like a torrential downpour

I'm the conductor of this symphony, I explore

The depths of my mind, the depths of the rain

On a rainy day, I'm the one who'll reign



(Bridge)

The rain, it cleanses, it washes away

All the pain and the sorrow that I face each day

I find solace in the storm, I find peace in the pour

On a rainy day, I'm the one they adore



(Chorus)

On a rainy day, I'm feeling so alive

I let the raindrops fall, as I strive

To paint a picture with my words, so vivid and clear

This rainy day rap, you won't forget, my dear



(Verse 3)

I stand in the rain, my words flow like a river

I'm the poet of the storm, the ultimate deliverer

I speak truth, I speak pain, I speak joy

I'm the rapper in the rain, the one they'll enjoy

So let the raindrops fall, let the rhythm take hold

On a rainy day, my story unfolds

I'll rap through the storm, I'll rap through the night

On a rainy day, I'll shine so bright



(Chorus)

On a rainy day, I'm feeling so alive

I let the raindrops fall, as I strive

To paint a picture with my words, so vivid and clear

This rainy day rap, you won't forget, my dear
