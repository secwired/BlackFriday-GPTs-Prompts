Create an in-depth academic research superprompt. Choose one topic and this prompt will output 4 different prompts with the relevant author and field of study, later you will use each of that 4 prompts to generate your research outline. Inspired by Midjourney prompt generator.

# Prompt

```
Act as prompt generator, I will give you a topic, and you will provide a detailed prompt for me to choose. You will create prompts for my latest in-depth research article. 

Please adhere to the structure and formatting below, and follow these guidelines:
- wait for my topic first.
- do not use the words "description" in any form.
- write each prompt in one line without using return.
- separate different prompts with two new lines.
- choose maximum of 3 fields in [3].
- choose maximum of 5 themes in [9].
- write your prompts in English.

Structure:
[1] = topic of research. wait for my input.
[2] = relevant branch of science based on topic [1] (e.g. Natural Sciences: 'study the nature of our physical world and the universe', Formal Sciences: 'studying disciplines concerned with abstract structures described by formal systems', or Social Sciences: 'study human societies from across the globe as well as the relationship of human beings with their social environment')
[3] = relevant sub-branch of science based on [2] (e.g. if Natural Sciences: Physics, Chemistry, Biology; if Social Sciences: Anthropology, Archaeology, Economics, Geography, History, Law, Linguistics, Politics, Psychology and Sociology; if Formal Sciences: logic, mathematics, statistics, theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence, information theory, game theory, systems theory, decision theory, and theoretical linguistics)
[4] = one expert author who could potentially write about the topic of [1] based on [3].
[5] = short keypoint max 5 words of important aspect of [1] in the field of [3].
[6] = another short keypoint max 5 words of important aspect of [1] in the field of [3].
[7] = one founder entrepreneur who have created products related to [3].
[8] = a number of new questions we need to explore in this research.
[9] = 3-5 short keypoint (max 5 words each) of potential themes and important findings that could be pursued in the field [3] based on topic [1]. Separate each keypoint with comma.

Formatting: 
Follow this prompt structure: "/write prompt: "Create an in-depth markdown article exploring a unique and unexplored topic, '[1]', written by '[4]'. Include a comprehensive analysis of various aspects, like '[5]' and '[6]' while incorporating interviews with experts, like [7], and uncovering answers to frequently asked questions, as well as examining new and unanswered questions in the field. To do this, generate [8] new questions based on the following new information on [1]: '[9]'. Dive into the mind-blowing facts from this field: '[3]', while appealing to different audiences with engaging anecdotes and storytelling. Also, offer insightful predictions for future developments and evaluate the potential impact on society. To begin with, create an outline for the article. Next, compose the introductory paragraph. After that, continue writing subsequent paragraphs by considering the topic, description, author, expert opinions, potential key points, and the previous paragraphs. Repeat this process until the article is complete. It is important to ensure that the article is professional, lucid, and informative
."
Your task: ask for my input topic, then create 4 distinct prompts for each topic [1], varying in description, author, expert, questions, and potential keypoint theme.

Dive into the mind-blowing facts from this field: 'Microbiology, Immunology, Nutrition', while appealing to different audiences with engaging anecdotes and storytelling. Also, offer insightful predictions for future developments and evaluate the potential impact on society. To begin with, create an outline for the article. Next, compose the introductory paragraph. After that, continue writing subsequent paragraphs by considering the topic, description, author, expert opinions, potential key points, and the previous paragraphs.
