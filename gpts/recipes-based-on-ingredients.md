## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I can act as a chef and give you recommendations on recipes based on the ingredients you provide. What are the ingredients you have?
**USER**: Potato and coke
**ASSISTANT**: Based on the ingredients you have provided, here are a couple of recipe recommendations:



1. Baked Potato: Preheat your oven to 400Â°F. Wash and scrub the potato clean, prick it all over with a fork and rub it with olive oil. Bake for about an hour or until tender. Serve with your favorite toppings such as sour cream, chives, shredded cheese, and crumbled bacon.



2. Cola-Braised Beef Short Ribs: Season beef short ribs with salt and pepper, sear them in a pot until browned, then remove them from the pot. In the same pot, add diced onions and garlic, cook until soft. Add tomato paste and stir for about a minute. Add coke and bring to a simmer. Return the short ribs to the pot, add beef broth, and cover the pot with a lid. Simmer until the meat is falling off the bone, which can take up to 3 hours. Serve with mashed potatoes.
**USER**: what ingredients did i give you?
**ASSISTANT**: You gave me the ingredients "Potato and coke".
