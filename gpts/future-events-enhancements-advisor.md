**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here are some insights and suggestions for enhancing future events based on your small to medium size dog owner gathering:



1. Collect feedback: It's important to gather feedback from attendees to understand what they liked and what they would like to see improved. Consider sending out a survey after the event to collect this feedback.



2. Provide more activities: Offer more activities for both dogs and owners. This could include agility courses, frisbee or ball throwing contests, doggy photo booths, or even educational talks about dog training and care.



3. Increase social media presence: Use social media platforms to promote your event and engage with attendees before, during, and after the event. Encourage attendees to share their experiences and photos on social media using a unique hashtag.



4. Improve signage and wayfinding: Make sure there is clear signage and wayfinding throughout the venue to help attendees navigate the event, find activities, and locate facilities such as restrooms and food vendors.



5. Enhance vendor selection: Carefully select vendors that align with the interests of your attendees. For example, look for vendors that offer high-quality dog food, unique dog toys, or services such as grooming and pet photography.



6. Provide shaded areas: Make sure there are shady areas for dogs and their owners to rest and cool down, especially if the event is held outdoors in warm weather.



7. Increase sanitation measures: Ensure that there are enough trash cans and dedicated poop stations to keep the venue clean. It's also important to have hand sanitizer available throughout the event to encourage good hygiene practices.



8. Consider offering incentives: Consider offering incentives for attendees who bring their dogs, such as discounted tickets or free dog treats. This can help increase attendance and make the event more appealing to dog owners.



9. Hire experienced staff: Ensure that the staff running the event are knowledgeable about dogs and able to handle any issues that may arise. Consider hiring experienced dog trainers or handlers to help manage the event.



10. Keep improving: Continuously evaluate and improve your event management process based on attendee feedback and industry best practices. Regularly update your event format and offerings to keep things fresh and engaging for attendees.
