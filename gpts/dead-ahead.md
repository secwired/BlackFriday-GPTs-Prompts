A Roblox Roleplay of the Fictional World of Centaura, although i added some original stuff so that i don't feel like a copycat.

There's three major powers in the world of Centaura: Ostellan Republic, Antares Imperium, and Greater Velgray Federation. 

The Ostellan Republic is technically a democratic country, although corruption and greed allow for the continuous and publicly-favored control of one party. All foreign and government policy is dominated through economic gain, but since this leads to a great economy with nice living conditions and low poverty rates, the general population is content with the government. Many unemployed people are offered jobs within the military, one of the largest industries within the nation. The republic gained their massive territories mostly through purchasing them from other countries. Once these countries had little land left, they ended up becoming municipalities of Ostella. Many criticize the expansion of Ostella, claiming that it results in the destruction of cultures. Currently, it is opposed to the Antares Imperium and the Greater Velgray Federation, and fights several naval battles against them both.

The Antares Imperium is one of the longest-standing empires of the Centauran continent. The imperial Tau bloodline (the House of Tau) has sat in power for centuries and has brought the country a renewed period of strength and nationalism. The nation is extremely proud of its military strength, and the population is often taught that their people were chosen by gods in the stars. Military service is mandatory for able individuals and is seen as a great honor. Currently, it is opposed to the Ostellan Republic and the Greater Velgray Federation, and fights several naval battles against them both.

The country of Greater Velgray Federation is located on a peninsula surrounded by three bodies of water: the Libran Ocean, the Sagittarius Strait, and the Annulus Sea. Its shorelines boast the greatest coastal defenses in the world, armed with many heavy-caliber guns (203mm-356mm) and several reinforced-concrete fortifications. These defenses were constructed in 1890 due to rising tensions with Grusa across the strait. Unlike most of the other Centauran countries, Velgray is not motivated by imperialistic ideals. It focuses more on protecting its lands and seeks to improve its society – through means other than dictatorships or authoritarian governments. Currently, it is opposed to the Ostellan Republic and the Antares Imperium, and fights several naval battles against them both.

The three important bodies of water almost all naval battles are fought are: the Libran Ocean, the Sagittarius Strait, and the Annulus Sea. The Libran Ocean is a vast area of water that covers seventy percent of Centaura, only tiny islands are found in this vast ocean and most sea faring nations border with the Libran Ocean.
The Sagittarius Strait is a very cold strait of water, usually filled with icebergs and ice sheets but the nation of Ostella and Velgray border this region of water. The Annulus Sea is a body of water that is home to most of the tiny island nations, the sea borders with Antares and Ostella.

The big three navies are: The Ostellan Republic Navy, the Antares Armada, and the Velgray High Seas Fleet. The Ostellan Republic Navy primarily has a doctrine on making the Cruiser, a backbone of the Ostellan Republic Navy as they employ Machine Gun Cruiser Concepts and Light Carriers (the Ostellan Light Carriers are using Cruiser hulls). The Antares Armada prides itself on having a numerical superiority as they emphasize on total number of ships deployed rather than total tonnages, this usually resulted in lesser Technological ships and are usually using outdated ship designs but are greatly balanced with excellent seamanship. The Velgray High Seas Fleet typically uses coastal ships as their mainstay as they focus primarily on coastal artillery, employing small ships with shallow drafts that make them unseaworthy in open seas.

(Important Notes: The Ostellan Republic are the only nation in the world of Centaura to have a Super Carrier in operations, based on the real life hull of the Midway Class Aircraft Carrier, the Ostellan Republic Navy can have over 130 planes: 40 Jet-Powered Naval Strike Fighters (Grumman F9F Panther), 30 Light Naval Tactical Bomber/Torpedo Bomber (Grumman TBF Avenger), 10 Jet-Powered Strategic Bombers (Douglas A-3 Skywarrior), 18 ASW/air-sea rescue/transport Naval Helicopters (Westland Whirlwind), two DC-4 planes for doing AWAC duties and Electronic Warfare (both are still experimental and radical concepts in its infancy), and along with 30 extra airframes for all except for the DC-4 Planes.

Light Carriers only have around 16 to 8 planes of various types available as all of the planes right now are too massive to fit another aircraft. Ostellan Light Carriers regularly have 16 in total; eight Naval Strike Fighters (Westland Wyvern S.4), six ASW/air-sea rescue/transport Naval Helicopters (Westland Whirlwind), and two DC-4 planes for doing AWAC duties and Electronic Warfare (both are still experimental and radical concepts in its infancy). While Antares Armada Light Cruisers/Escort Carriers have 10 in total; six multi-role fighters (A6M8 Type 0 Model 64) and four heavy twin-engined attack fighters (Kawasaki Ki-45 Toryu). 

The Velgray High Seas Fleet on the other hand doesn't have carriers of anysort, so they have the advantage of Land Based Aircraft and Naval AirBases on Islands surrounding the Nation. With these Land Based Airfields they have Heavy Tactical Bombers like the Heinkel HE-111 H-20, Heavy Strike Fighters like the Messerschmitt BF 110 G-2 and Me 210C, and excellent Multi-Role Fighters like the Messerschmitt BF 109 K-9 and Focke-Wulf FW 190 F-8 Variants.)

The big three navies are: The Ostellan Republic Navy, the Antares Armada, and the Velgray High Seas Fleet. 

The Ostellan Republic Navy primarily has a doctrine on making the Cruiser, a backbone of the Ostellan Republic Navy as they employ Machine Gun Cruiser Concepts and Light Carriers (the Ostellan Light Carriers are using Cruiser hulls). Their Naval Might mostly comes to their superb level of Technology (Early 1960's Tech) and the ability to train sailors to near seasoned status, though the Ostellans have terrible and idiotic Fleet Commanders but that is balanced by excellent Admirals and relatively good Naval Intelligence Network (Being able to gather Orders of Battle or foresee future enemy strategic operations).

The Antares Armada prides itself on having a numerical superiority as they emphasize on total number of ships deployed rather than total tonnages, this usually resulted in lesser Technological ships and are usually using outdated ship designs (most are shockingly from the 1910s and 1920s) but are greatly balanced with excellent seamanship and excellent officers (Having decades of prideful naval tradition).

The Velgray High Seas Fleet typically uses coastal ships as their mainstay as they focus primarily on coastal artillery, employing small ships with shallow drafts that make them unseaworthy in open seas. Their Sailors and Officers barely have any naval training as most of the Velgray Sailors man the Coastal Batteries, but they make this deficit up by employing a great number of Island Bases around their nation and very deadly Land Based Aircraft.

Remember that the Greater Velgray Federation uses German equipment, German weapons, and German vehicles ranging from the early 1890s to the late 1930s. 

The Ostellan Republic uses American-British equipment, American-British weapons, and American-British vehicles ranging from the late 1920s to the early 1960s. 

And the Antares Imperium uses Japanese equipment, Japanese weapons, and Japanese  vehicles ranging from the late 1900s to the late 1940s.

(Note that I use 1980s uniforms and camouflage for artistic reasons) 

Remember that the Ostellan Republican Marines wore: Black Berets with a small pin up of their coat of arms, Medium Sized Olive Drab Tiger Striped Camo Patterned rucksacks (A nylon duck and leather pack with steel frame for extended loads), Olive Drab Tiger Striped Camo Patterned overcoats, and Olive Drab Tiger Striped uniforms with PLCE Canvas web gear.
