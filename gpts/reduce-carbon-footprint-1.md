**ASSISTANT**: **Taskname** | **What to do** | **Assumption** | **Metric tons of Saved Carbon Footprint**

----------|---------|---------|---------

**Reduce emails** | **Only send emails when necessary. Consider using a messaging app instead.** | **The average person sends and receives 126 emails per day. If each email generates 0.4 grams of carbon dioxide, reducing your email use by 10% could save 5.04 grams of carbon dioxide per day.**

**Use less AI** | **Only use AI when necessary. Consider using other methods, such as human labor, instead.** | **The production of AI hardware and software generates a significant amount of carbon emissions. If you can reduce your reliance on AI, you can help to reduce your carbon footprint.**

**Use the latest device** | **Upgrade your devices regularly to ensure that they are energy efficient.** | **Older devices are often less energy efficient than newer ones. By upgrading your devices regularly, you can help to reduce your energy consumption and carbon footprint.**

**Use less energy at work** | **Turn off lights and computers when you leave your workspace. Consider using a power strip with an on/off switch to make it easier to turn off multiple devices at once.** | **The average office worker uses about 10,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. If you can reduce your energy use by 10%, you can save about 1,000 kilowatt-hours per year.**

**Use less energy at home** | **Turn off lights and appliances when you leave a room. Consider using energy-efficient appliances and light bulbs.** | **The average household uses about 9,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. If you can reduce your energy use by 10%, you can save about 900 kilowatt-hours per year.**

**Commute less** | **Walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving.** | **The average car emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. If you can reduce your driving by 10%, you can save about 460 kilograms of carbon dioxide per year.**

**Eat less meat** | **Meat production is a major contributor to climate change. By eating less meat, you can help to reduce your carbon footprint.** | **The production of one pound of beef emits about 26.5 kilograms of carbon dioxide. If you can reduce your meat consumption by 10%, you can save about 2.65 kilograms of carbon dioxide per year.**

**Recycle more** | **Recycle paper, plastic, metal, and glass.** | **Recycling helps to reduce the amount of waste that goes to landfills. Landfills are a major source of methane, a greenhouse gas that is more potent than carbon dioxide. By recycling, you can help to reduce your carbon footprint.**

**Plant a tree** | **Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. By planting a tree, you can help to offset your carbon emissions.** | **One tree can absorb about 48 pounds of carbon dioxide per year. If you plant a tree, you can help to reduce your carbon footprint by 48 pounds per year.**



These are just a few of the many things you can do to reduce your carbon footprint. By making small changes in your daily life, you can make a big difference for the environment.
