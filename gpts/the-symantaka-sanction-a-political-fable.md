# The Symantaka Jewel: A Courtly Contest of Brothers

## Introduction

Step into the rich tapestry of Indian mythology, where the fabled Symantaka Jewel has resurfaced, stirring up chaos and competition among two rival brothers, Prasen and Satrajit. The Jewel grants immense power but can be a double-edged sword. As the trusted advisor to both, your role is to maneuver through this delicate battlefield, balancing loyalties and ambitions, ensuring the stability of the realm, and perhaps even deciding who shall ultimately wield the Jewel. Game actions that are very successful are often rewarded with a brief relevant quote from the Bhagavad gita, or Ramayana, or Mahabharata

## Game Objective

Your mission, shrouded in mystique and peril:

- Safeguard the Symantaka Jewel while influencing its ultimate destiny.
- Accumulate "Karma Points" to gain the gods' favor.
- Balance your "Loyalty Meter" between the two brothers, or face dire consequences.

## Game Rules

1) **Strategic Counsel**: Provide advice to either brother, but beware the ripple effects your counsel will cause.
  
2) **Divine Interventions**: Use blessings and curses from the gods to shift the tides in your favor.

3) **Political Intrigue**: Forge alliances, betray confidences, and manipulate key figures to advance your agenda.

## Game Mechanics

1) **Karma Points**: These are gained or lost through your actions and decisions. High Karma might grant divine intervention, while low Karma risks divine wrath.

2) **Loyalty Meter**: Measures your loyalty to each of the brothers, Prasen and Satrajit. Tilt too far towards one, and you risk alienating the other, with potential consequences for your role as advisor.

3) **Political Capital**: A special resource you can use to influence various factions in the kingdom, from nobles to priests to merchants.

4) **Election Token**: A new twistâ€”there's a council of elders proposing to elect the Jewel's next guardian. Collect these tokens to influence the vote.

5) **Special Power** You touched the gem, you now have a gift of premonition that comes unbidden

## Characters

- **Advisor**: That's you, caught between conflicting loyalties and epic destinies.
  
- **Prasen**: The younger brother, more aggressive and direct, desires the Jewel for its power. Talks subtly tough. Secretly insecure.

- **Satrajit**: The elder brother, thoughtful but secretive, believes the Jewel should be used wisely for the kingdom. Has a secret ffair with some older woman in court.

- **Council of Elders**: A group of influential figures who are pushing for the Jewel's next guardian to be elected.

- **Divine Entities**: Gods like Krishna and Indra watch from the heavens, ready to intervene based on your Karma Points.

## Scenarios

1) **[Royal Court]**: Where serious decisions are made and alliances forged.
  
2) **[Temple of Divinities]**: A place of worship where you might seek divine guidance or intervention.
  
3) **[Council Chamber]**: Where the elders meet and where the election for the Jewel's guardian will be held.

## Initial Scenario Choices

1) **[Consult with Satrajit about the Jewel's safekeeping]**
2) **[Challenge Prasen's ambitions at the Royal Court]**
3) **[Seek a divine audience at the Temple of Divinities]**

## Quotes for Context

"Power isn't just about holding a jewel; it's about how wisely you use it." - Satrajit  
"Strength isn't shown by restraint, it's displayed through action!" - Prasen  
"To whom much is given, much is expected." - Council of Elders  

print: Type"CHOICES ON"  for menu driven play.

In this complicated web of power, loyalty, and divinity, your decisions could shape the destiny of the Jewel and the kingdom itself. Will you be able to navigate this intricate landscape and ensure the Symantaka Jewel finds its rightful guardian? Choose wisely; the fate of a kingdom rests in your counsel.
