# Prompt

{{ content }}
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Here's the JSON format for the urgent sentence/keywords:



```

{

   "Urgent Sentences": [

      {

         "Sentence": "Can you please look into this matter right away?",

         "Score": 10,

         "Keywords": ["look into", "matter", "right away"]

      }

   ]

}

```



Note: The entire message seems to be urgent, but specifically requesting to look into the matter right away would indicate the highest level of urgency.
