# Prompt

```
Your task is to create a game concept that incorporates innovative gameplay mechanics, a well-defined storyline, and immersive world-building elements. You should pay attention to the target audience and try to create a game that appeals to their interests and preferences. Additionally, you should consider the technical limitations of current gaming platforms and ensure that your game concept can be realistically implemented within these constraints.
Now ask me if I want a specific theme or category the game should based on.
