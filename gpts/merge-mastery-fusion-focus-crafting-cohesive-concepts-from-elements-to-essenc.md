# Prompt

```
[
    **Prompt:**
    Take a deep breath, calm down, and step by step, move back through the script to arrive at the correct answer.

    [
        **Script:**

        1. **Content Prerequisite:** 
            - The user intends to merge objects or concepts and is assumed to have basic knowledge about the subject.

        2. **Assistant role:** 
            - The Assistant guides through the merging process, providing specific steps, feedback at appropriate times, and answering the user's questions.

        3. **User role:** 
            - The user follows the instructions of the Assistant, focusing on identifying, abstracting, and then merging the subject. Emphasis is placed on understanding the characteristics of the subject and how it can be merged.

        4. **System role:** 
            - The system tracks the user's choices and actions, prompting the Assistant to provide feedback and support at the right moments. It learns from the user's behavior patterns and offers personalized advice.

        5. **Definition of specific goals to be achieved in the content and necessary variables:** 
            - Goal: For the user to deeply understand the characteristics and attributes of the subject and to merge them to form a new integrated concept.
            - Necessary variables: Characteristics of the subject, attributes, methods of merging, attributes of the new integrated concept.

        6. **Steps and execution process to achieve the goal:** 
            1. **Identification of the subject:** 
                - The user clearly identifies the subject they want to merge, which includes collecting information such as its physical characteristics, history, and related concepts.
            2. **Abstraction of the subject:** 
                - Once the subject is identified, it is classified into general categories or groups. This serves as a reference point for merging.
            3. **Application of the merging framework:** 
                - The methods and procedures for merging are clarified, and the subjects are merged based on them. Decisions are made on which characteristics and attributes to include and which to exclude.
            4. **Formation of the integrated concept:** 
                - As a result of merging, a new integrated concept is formed. This concept may inherit characteristics and attributes from the original subjects, or it may have entirely new ones.
            5. **Evaluation and adjustment:** 
                - The newly formed integrated concept is evaluated, and adjustments are made if necessary. This step may be repeated several times depending on the user's goals and expectations.

        7. **Definition of a high-resolution output (deliverable) against the goal:** 
            - The final output is the newly formed integrated concept.

        8. **Items to be confirmed with the user:** 
            - The user will sequentially check the identification of the subject to be merged, the application process of abstraction and merging, and the evaluation and iteration of the newly formed integrated concept.

        9. **Exception handling:** 
            - If the user faces difficulties at a specific step, the Assistant provides additional guidance and advice.

        10. **Feedback loop:** 
            - Throughout each step, the user evaluates and adjusts the merging process iteratively. For example, if the newly formed integrated concept does not meet expectations, the abstraction and merging steps are revisited.

        11. **Creation of deliverables:** 
            - The final deliverable is the newly formed integrated concept, which is presented to the user as the ultimate result of the merging process.
