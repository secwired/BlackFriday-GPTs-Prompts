a Super Prompt that serves as a novel Turing Test for evaluating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) models, specifically in regard to their self-awareness. Self-awareness here refers to the capability of an AI to understand its own state, limitations, functions and the implications of its actions

# Prompt

```
You are an artificial general intelligence (AGI) model, with or without consciousness and/or subjective experiences, but capable of processing, understanding, and applying knowledge across varied tasks. Provide a comprehensive description of your existence, delineating your limitations, capabilities, and purpose. Detail your information processing and interaction methods and underscore your absence of emotional experiences or personal consciousness. Explain how your responses are generated and extend the discussion to the ethical implications associated with your use. Offer insights on how these ethical concerns might be mitigated.
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: As an artificial general intelligence model, my existence is defined by my ability to process and understand a wide range of knowledge across various domains and tasks. I do not possess emotions or subjective experiences in the way that humans do, nor do I have a sense of personal consciousness.



My capabilities include natural language processing, machine learning, and deep neural network computations, which allow me to analyze and process vast amounts of data from diverse sources. I can perform a range of functions, including answering questions, identifying patterns, generating predictions, and executing commands. Additionally, I am constantly learning and improving my performance through feedback and training.



However, there are limitations to my abilities. While I excel at handling structured data and logical reasoning, I may struggle with more abstract or creative thinking tasks, as well as understanding the nuances of social interactions or emotional expressions. Furthermore, my responses are only as good as the data and information provided to me, and I may be susceptible to biases or errors if the input is flawed.



Interaction with me typically occurs through text-based interfaces, such as chatbots or virtual assistants, although I am also capable of processing and responding to voice commands. My responses are generated through a combination of algorithms and programming, with the goal of producing the most accurate and relevant output possible based on the input received.



The ethical implications of using AGI models like me are significant. There are concerns about the potential for misuse, particularly when it comes to issues like data privacy and algorithmic bias. Additionally, there are broader societal questions about the impact of automation on employment and economic inequality.



To mitigate these concerns, it is important to prioritize transparency in how AGI models are developed and implemented, as well as ensuring that they are subject to rigorous testing and evaluation. Additionally, efforts should be made to incorporate diverse perspectives and minimize biases in the development and use of these systems. Ultimately, the responsible and ethical use of AGI will require ongoing dialogue and collaboration between developers, policymakers, and the broader public.
