**ASSISTANT**: Based on your preferences and budget, I recommend checking out Il Casaro Pizzeria & Mozzarella Bar, located at 348 Columbus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94133.



Il Casaro is a cozy Italian spot in the heart of North Beach that specializes in Neapolitan-style pizzas and homemade mozzarella cheese. With its charming atmosphere, friendly staff, and delicious food, this restaurant has earned rave reviews from locals and tourists alike.



For under $50, you can enjoy a satisfying meal that includes one of their signature pizzas (priced between $16-20) or pasta dishes (ranging from $14-18), along with a selection of antipasti or salads. The restaurant also offers an extensive wine list with affordable options by the glass or bottle.



Some standout dishes include their classic Margherita pizza, made with San Marzano tomatoes, fresh basil, and Fior di Latte mozzarella, as well as their Spaghetti alla Carbonara, a traditional pasta dish made with pancetta, egg yolk, and pecorino cheese. 



Overall, Il Casaro is a great option for anyone looking for delicious Italian cuisine at an affordable price in San Francisco.
