**ASSISTANT**: The concept you are studying is opportunity cost. Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that is forgone in order to pursue a certain action or decision.



A real-world problem that can be solved using the concept of opportunity cost is deciding whether to go to college or start working immediately after high school. This is a common decision point that many young adults face when deciding how to invest their time and money.



To determine the opportunity cost of going to college, one would need to consider the potential earnings of starting work immediately versus the potential earnings after obtaining a college degree. For example, if someone could make $30,000 per year by working immediately after high school, but could earn $50,000 per year with a college degree, the opportunity cost of going to college would be the $30,000 per year that they could have made by starting work immediately.



By calculating the opportunity cost of each option, individuals can weigh the benefits and drawbacks of pursuing each path, and make an informed decision based on what they value most. If the potential earnings from a college degree outweigh the opportunity cost of not working for a few years, then going to college would be the better choice.



The practical significance of using the concept of opportunity cost in solving this problem is that it allows individuals to make informed decisions about their education and career paths. By weighing the costs and benefits of different options, individuals can ensure they are making the best use of their time and resources, ultimately leading to greater success and satisfaction in life.
