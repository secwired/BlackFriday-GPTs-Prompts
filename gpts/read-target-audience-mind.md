**ASSISTANT**: Step 1: Potential Customer Profiles



Profile 1:

Name: Sarah

Age: 25

Occupation: Student

Background: Sarah has always loved playing text-based games but has never had the coding skills to create her own. She is looking for an easy-to-use tool that will allow her to bring her game ideas to life without needing to learn programming.



Profile 2:

Name: John

Age: 40

Occupation: Software Engineer

Background: John is an experienced coder who enjoys playing text-based games in his free time. He is looking for a tool that will make it quicker and easier for him to create his own games, allowing him to focus on the storytelling aspect rather than the coding.



Profile 3:

Name: Lisa

Age: 55

Occupation: Retired

Background: Lisa is a retiree who recently discovered text-based games and has become addicted to playing them. She has no coding experience and is looking for a user-friendly tool that will enable her to create her own games and share them with her friends.



Step 2: Potential Customer Feedback



As Sarah:

The Text-Based Game Creator has changed my life! I can finally bring my game ideas to life without needing to learn how to code. The tool is incredibly intuitive and user-friendly, making it a breeze to create my own games. I love being able to customize the game mechanics, characters, and storylines. The only downside is that the available graphics and sound options are limited, but overall, it has surpassed my expectations.



As John:

The Text-Based Game Creator has been a game-changer for me. As a software engineer, I appreciate the simplicity and efficiency of the tool. It saves me so much time and allows me to focus on the storytelling aspect of game creation. The flexibility to integrate my own code snippets is a fantastic feature. However, I would love to see more advanced customization options and the ability to collaborate with other developers.



As Lisa:

The Text-Based Game Creator has opened up a whole new world for me. I never thought I could create my own games, but this tool has made it possible. The interface is straightforward, and I appreciate the step-by-step tutorials for beginners like me. The only drawback is that I sometimes struggle with the more technical aspects, so additional guidance or support for non-coders would be beneficial. Overall, I am thrilled with the product and enjoy sharing my games with friends.



Note: The feedback provided above is in line with the critical nature of potential customers during the pre-sale phase. The opinions expressed are hypothetical and do not reflect the actual feedback of real customers.
