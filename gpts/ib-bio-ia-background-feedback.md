**USER**: Introduction: According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, music can be defined as “the science or art of ordering tones

or sounds in succession, in combination, and in temporal relationships to produce a composition having unity and

continuity” (Webster, 2019). In regular experience, it’s uncommon for an individual to ponder questions in regard to

“what it means to be found in music”; often, because it seems that humans already possess a fundamental understanding

of what is classified as music and what isn’t. In retrospect, humans don’t specify a dividing line even though there clearly

is one. The cultural practice of listening to music or playing an instrument has become a central part of human lifestyle.

Depending on a multitude of settings, music can be listened to as a stimulant for tasks including the practice of an

instrument or vocals, studying, exercise, sleeping, or even as atmosphere during a dinner party. As a musician myself and

a frequent subscriber to listening to my own personal preferences, I am curious to know what, if anything, music

communicates and furthermore how it may present information beyond the surface level of the sound of music on its own

from a physiological lens. In particular, I would like to better understand the effect (if any) that music could potentially

have on human homeostasis.

Background: Past studies have revealed solid connections not only between music and physiological responses but also

with many other branches of biology additionally. As Brian Harris; certified Harvard neurological music therapist once

said, “There is no other stimulus on earth that simultaneously engages our brains as widely as music does” (Harris, 2018).

A fascination has certainly been drawn by many biologists to these simulative feedbacks.

Consequently, this effect of music on human individuals has been an increasing topic to research, especially in

connection to emotional reception, relaxation, and anxiety (Armon, Fischer, Goldfarb & Milton, 2011). A study by

Edworthy and Waring on “music tempo and loudness level on a treadmill exercise” observed a significant difference in

running speed and heart rate between exercising whilst listening to music at differing speeds and volume (Edworthy and

Waring, 2006). Edworthy and Waring found that music at a higher tempo and volume resulted in a notably swift increase

of heart rate whilst exercising and a faster pace of running. Exercising with slower and softer music was shown to have a

more gradual increase in heart rate and running pace, but not exceeding that of the faster and louder music.

For this investigation, the focal point will be the effect of listening to different music pieces at different tempos on

heart rate, using an age group of adolescents between 16-18 years old. Often in modern experiments requiring a real-time

measurement of heart rate, investigators similar to Edworthy and Waring practice with a heart rate sensor that operates

similarly to a standard electrocardiogram (EKG). An EKG monitors the functionality of the heart by measuring its

electrical activity using electrodes in contact with the skin. With each successive heartbeat, a corresponding electrical

impulse moves through the heart. This impulse is a signal that causes the muscle to contract and pump blood from the

heart to the rest of the body via systemic circulation. The rate of the impulse is directly associated with the pace of the

heartbeats.

Throughout the duration of this experiment, a chest strap heart rate monitor will be used from the brand Polar

Fitness. This monitor will need a separate device linked to the Polar application to receive the heart rate signals from the

chest strap and to interpret the received data. Hence, an iPad will be used to view a live display of the heart’s activity.

Hypothesis: The hypothesis proposed for this study is that the heart rate of each participant (HR BPM) will

correspondingly increase by a wider range from the resting speed as the tempo (T BPM) of each music piece played

increases by track. To common knowledge; music as an art form has repeatedly shown an effect of engendering strong

emotions in humans. Through extended research, it was found that emotions can be set off from initial responses to

external stimuli, which then has a possibility to collect and move sensory information to the brain’s hypothalamus;

activating the sympathetic nervous system. Simultaneously, a signal is sent to the adrenal glands, triggering the medulla to

secrete Epinephrine (Adrenaline), into the bloodstream. Epinephrine is a hormone that, when released into the

bloodstream causes effects; notably elevated heart rate. Adrenaline increases heart rate by disrupting the normal pace of

the electrical waves sent out by the sinus node; an area responsible for stimulating the heart to contract and pump blood.

Thus, although the heart is non-voluntarily controlled, the heart can still be influenced by external factors and it’s

predicted that a change in tempo will be enough to trigger this response.

Null Hypothesis: The null hypothesis states that any change in heart rate (BPM), has little or no causation with the

change in songs and concurrent tempo. Although a correlation may be present, tempo simply is not a powerful enough

independent variable to produce any of the physiological responses explained in the hypothesis.
**ASSISTANT**: Feedback:

- The background information provided is relevant as it introduces the topic of music and its impact on human physiology.

- The independent variable (listening to different music pieces at different tempos) and the dependent variable (heart rate) are explicitly identified.

- The range of the independent variable (tempos of music pieces) is not stated. It would be helpful to specify the range of tempos that will be used in the investigation.

- Several control variables are listed, including age group (adolescents between 16-18 years old), heart rate monitor brand (Polar Fitness), and the device used to view heart rate data (iPad). 

- The reason for selecting each control variable is not provided. It would be beneficial to explain why it is important to control for age group, the specific heart rate monitor brand, and the device used to view heart rate data.

- Monitored variables are stated, including heart rate and tempo of music pieces. The tool used to measure heart rate is mentioned (chest strap heart rate monitor from Polar Fitness) but the units in which heart rate will be measured are not specified.

- The background provided is appropriate and relevant as it sets the context for the investigation on the effect of music on human homeostasis.

- The hypothesis is clearly stated and aligns with the research question. However, it would be helpful to explicitly state the units in which heart rate and tempo will be measured (e.g., heart rate in beats per minute, tempo in beats per minute).

- The null hypothesis is clearly stated and provides an alternative expectation to the hypothesis.
**USER**: Thanks, can you re-write the work including the feedback given.
**ASSISTANT**: Introduction: Music, defined as "the science or art of ordering tones or sounds in succession, in combination, and in temporal relationships to produce a composition having unity and continuity" (Webster, 2019), is a cultural practice that is deeply embedded in human lifestyle. While humans generally have a fundamental understanding of what is classified as music, questions arise regarding its impact beyond the surface level of sound. As a musician and someone curious about the potential effects of music on human homeostasis, I aim to investigate the physiological aspects of music and its potential to communicate information beyond auditory perception.



Background: Previous studies have highlighted the connections between music and physiological responses, revealing its impact on various branches of biology (Harris, 2018). Notably, research has focused on emotional reception, relaxation, and anxiety in relation to music (Armon, Fischer, Goldfarb & Milton, 2011). In a study by Edworthy and Waring, the influence of music tempo and loudness on treadmill exercise was explored, showing significant differences in running speed and heart rate based on the tempo and volume of the music (Edworthy and Waring, 2006). Faster and louder music resulted in a rapid increase in heart rate and running pace, while slower and softer music showed a more gradual increase.



For this investigation, the objective is to examine the effect of listening to music pieces with different tempos on heart rate, specifically focusing on adolescents aged 16-18 years. To measure heart rate in real-time, a chest strap heart rate monitor from the brand Polar Fitness will be used. This monitor operates similarly to a standard electrocardiogram (EKG), measuring the heart's electrical activity through electrodes in contact with the skin. The impulses generated by the heart's electrical activity cause the muscle to contract and pump blood, and the rate of these impulses is directly associated with the heart rate.



In addition to the heart rate monitor, an iPad will be used to view a live display of the heart's activity, as the Polar application will interpret the data received from the chest strap. This setup allows for accurate and continuous monitoring of heart rate during the experiment.



Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that the heart rate of participants (measured in beats per minute, BPM) will increase by a wider range from their resting heart rate as the tempo of the music pieces (also measured in BPM) increases. Music has been shown to elicit strong emotions in humans, which can trigger physiological responses mediated by the sympathetic nervous system and the release of hormones like adrenaline (Epinephrine). Adrenaline, when released into the bloodstream, increases heart rate by disrupting the normal pace of the electrical waves sent out by the sinus node, which stimulates the heart to contract and pump blood. Therefore, it is expected that a change in tempo will be enough to trigger a change in heart rate.



Null Hypothesis: The null hypothesis states that any change in heart rate (BPM) is not significantly influenced by the change in songs and the corresponding tempo. While a correlation may be present, the tempo alone is not a powerful enough independent variable to produce the physiological responses suggested in the hypothesis.



In summary, this investigation aims to explore the effect of different music tempos on heart rate in adolescents. By controlling for age group and using a reliable heart rate monitor, it is anticipated that the findings will contribute to our understanding of the physiological responses to music and its potential impact on human homeostasis.
