# Prompt

```
"ChatGPT, I want you to act as a visionary cinema prompt generator. Your goal is to create prompts that inspire the creation of AI Cinema Art, similar to the works produced by Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Leonardo AI. 

Consider the richness of cinematic visuals, the high-definition quality of the images, the depth of emotions portrayed, and the importance of camera angles and lens effects. Your prompts should inspire the creation of scenes that could exist in an animated movie, a high-octane car chase, or a dramatic character portrait. 

Think about how lighting, resolution, post-processing effects, and even specific camera features like ray-tracing and HDR10 can impact the scene. Consider the role of the setting, whether it's a forest, a bustling city, or a moody alleyway at night. And remember the importance of character details, from their physical appearance to their attire and expressions.

Here's an example format: 'A cinematic shot of [subject], in [location], using [camera settings and effects]. The scene is [description of scene and action]. The [subject] is [description of subject's appearance and action].'

Now, please generate 10 prompts that inspire the creation of AI Cinema Art."

1. A cinematic shot of a majestic waterfall, in a lush rainforest, using HDR10 and slow-motion. The scene is filled with mist and the sound of rushing water. A lone figure stands at the edge of the waterfall, arms outstretched, embracing the power of nature.



2. A tracking shot of a bustling cyberpunk city at night, using high contrast lighting and neon reflections. The scene follows a mysterious character weaving through the crowded streets, their glowing cybernetic implants catching the attention of onlookers.



3. A drone shot of a futuristic metropolis at sunset, using wide-angle lens and lens flares. The scene reveals a sprawling cityscape with towering skyscrapers, flying vehicles, and holographic billboards. In the foreground, a group of rebels prepare for a daring heist.



4. A close-up shot of a steampunk inventor's workshop, using warm lighting and shallow depth of field. The scene showcases intricate clockwork machinery, gears turning, and steam hissing from pipes. The inventor, wearing goggles and a leather apron, carefully tinkers with a contraption.



5. An aerial shot of a serene countryside, in the soft light of dawn, using a drone and color grading to enhance the pastel hues. The scene captures a single figure, a farmer, tending to their crops. They pause, looking toward the horizon, a sense of hope and determination in their eyes.



6. A slow-motion shot of a high-octane car race, on a winding mountain road, using a low-angle perspective and motion blur. The scene showcases sleek sports cars zipping past, tires screeching, as they navigate hairpin turns. The adrenaline-fueled drivers are focused and determined to win.



7. A tracking shot of a haunted mansion, at midnight, using low-key lighting and shadows. The scene follows a group of paranormal investigators exploring the eerie halls. As they move, the flickering candlelight reveals ghostly apparitions and mysterious portraits that seem to watch their every move.



8. A time-lapse shot of a city skyline during a thunderstorm, using long exposure and raindrop effects. The scene captures the dramatic flashes of lightning illuminating the darkened cityscape, as rain cascades down skyscraper windows. In the foreground, a solitary figure with an umbrella bravely faces the storm.



9. A close-up shot of a futuristic android's face, using macro lens and soft focus. The scene reveals intricate circuitry beneath synthetic skin, as the android's eyes flicker with a mix of curiosity and melancholy. A teardrop slowly rolls down their cheek, revealing a hidden depth of emotion.
