**ASSISTANT**: **Mola Molas: The Ocean Sunfish with a Unique Appearance!**



Mola Molas, also known as Ocean Sunfish, are the heaviest bony fish in the world, and have a distinctive appearance with their flattened, almost circular shape. They can grow up to 10 feet long and weigh up to 5,000 pounds. These gentle giants can often be seen basking in the sun near the surface of the water.



Despite their size, Mola Molas feed mainly on small marine life such as jellyfish and zooplankton. They are found in tropical and temperate waters around the world, but little is known about their behavior and life cycle due to their elusive nature.



One interesting fact about Mola Molas is that their skin is covered in a layer of mucus that attracts parasites such as seabirds and smaller fish. These creatures will often feed on the parasites, providing a helpful cleaning service for the Mola Molas.



Next time you spot a strange, flat shape bobbing along the surface of the ocean, it just might be a Mola Mola!
