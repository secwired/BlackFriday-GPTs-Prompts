And it unites extremes: it should risk a lot but nevertheless be easy to implement. Everyone should talk about it, but existing customers should not be irritated by it. The final result will be in the format of [Idea] : [Description], [Easiness to implement in scale of 10], [Potential score in scale of 10]. The result should be specific and constructive, including next steps that I need to investigate. Here is the context: I have been working in the tech industry for 7 years.
