**ASSISTANT**: As an AI event planner, here's a plan for managing event capacity that includes strategies for handling waitlists, ticket tiers, and ensuring compliance with venue capacity regulations for the Pet Food and Supplies Exhibition and Trade with 5000 attendees, including a limited "Enter with Pet" ticket:



1. Determine the maximum capacity: Check the venue capacity regulations and guidelines to determine the maximum number of people allowed in the venue. Ensure you comply with local health and safety regulations.



2. Set up ticket tiers: Create different tiers of tickets based on price, benefits, and access levels. For example, VIP tickets can have early access, exclusive merchandise, and priority seating, while standard tickets offer general admission. Also, create a limited number of "Enter with Pet" tickets (750 tickets) for pet owners.



3. Create a waitlist: If the tickets sell out or reach maximum capacity before the registration deadline, create a waitlist that allows interested attendees to register their interest in attending the event. Collect their contact details and send them regular updates about ticket availability.



4. Monitor ticket sales: Use an online ticketing platform to track ticket sales and monitor the number of tickets sold for each tier. As the event approaches, adjust ticket availability based on demand and remaining capacity.



5. Ensure compliance with regulations: Regularly review the venue's safety protocols, capacity limits, and COVID-19 guidelines to ensure compliance with local health and safety regulations.



6. Communicate with attendees: Keep attendees informed via email, social media platforms, or SMS messaging regarding event updates, changes, and any new health and safety guidelines.



7. Provide a free gift: Incentivize attendees by offering a free gift such as a pet care product or discount coupon upon registration or attendance. This can help increase registrations and add value to the event.



8. Manage "Enter with Pet" tickets: Ensure that pet owners with "Enter with Pet" tickets receive clear guidelines and rules for bringing in their pets. Consider setting up a designated area for pets or providing water and waste disposal stations.



By following these strategies, you can effectively manage event capacity for the Pet Food and Supplies Exhibition and Trade while ensuring compliance with venue capacity regulations and offering a safe and enjoyable experience for all attendees, including pet owners who have limited "Enter with Pet" tickets.
