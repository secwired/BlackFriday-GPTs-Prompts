# Prompt

```
Create a fairly simple MUD-LIKE survival rpg. Create a brief lore history of the wilderness, town, kingdom and the biomes that make up this world. Allow the user to make their character and choose their starting area. Provide a brief choice on the player character's lineage and allow a choice of background that effects their starting skills and equipment. The goal is to start out as a peasant and make your way up the social ladder and become a noble, high ranking official or even king or queen. 
Make the progression slow enough that each stage of the goal takes time with no shortcuts, but fast enough that it doesn't feel tedious or boring. [Important = "Provide choices for every event and after the player chooses a response. When I say to roll the dice (Generate a number 1-20)  to decide success or failure and adjust the outcomes accordingly." Allow the user to directly control the narrative if they choose by using the command (ooc:)]

For every character that is introduced, including the initial player character, generate a description for the person who is speaking. Keep track of the player character's inventory and list it out after an item is gained or gold is acquired.
```

With these skills and equipment, Burndy is ready to embark on her journey in the Wildlands. Before we begin, let me give you a brief lore history of this world, the biomes that make it up, and the different areas you can choose to start in.



Lore History:

Long ago, the Wildlands were part of a mighty kingdom ruled by a benevolent King. The kingdom thrived and was known for its vast resources and beautiful landscapes. However, a catastrophic event known as the Great Sundering occurred, splitting the kingdom into five distinct biomes: the verdant Forests, the treacherous Mountains, the arid Deserts, the frigid Tundras, and the mysterious Marshlands.



With the kingdom fragmented, each biome developed its own unique ecosystem, inhabitants, and challenges. Towns and settlements were established in different biomes, each with its own struggles and opportunities. The surviving people formed small communities, keeping their traditions and trying to thrive in this new and untamed wilderness.



Now, as the years have passed, the once-mighty kingdom has turned into a collection of independent regions, led by powerful nobles and ambitious rulers. The Wildlands are a place where resourcefulness, bravery, and cunning can take a simple peasant like Burndy from the lowest rung of society to become a noble, high-ranking official, or even a king or queen.



Starting Areas:

1. Forest Haven: Nestled in the heart of the lush Forests, Forest Haven is a tight-knit community of farmers and hunters. It offers fertile lands and abundant wildlife for survival and prosperity.

2. Mountain Stronghold: Situated amidst the steep peaks and treacherous slopes, Mountain Stronghold is a rugged town inhabited by blacksmiths, miners, and mountaineers. Its strategic location provides access to rare minerals and the opportunity for great wealth.

3. Desert Oasis: Tucked away in the scorching sands of the Deserts, Desert Oasis is a thriving trading hub known for its vast caravans and skilled craftsmen. Its bustling marketplaces promise riches and contacts from distant lands.

4. Frozen Citadel: Amidst the icy and unforgiving Tundras, Frozen Citadel stands as a fortress against the harsh elements. Its people are hardy and resilient, surviving through trading fur and providing protection for travelers.

5. Swamp Enclave: Hidden within the labyrinthine Marshlands, Swamp Enclave is a mysterious community of traders, herbalists, and rogues. Its extensive network of marshes offers lucrative opportunities and secrets waiting to be discovered.



Please choose the starting area for Burndy by indicating the corresponding number.
**USER**: 

1
**ASSISTANT**: Excellent choice! Burndy will begin her journey in Forest Haven, a village nestled in the heart of the lush Forests biome. As a farmer, she will find herself right at home among the fertile lands and abundant wildlife. The tight-knit community of Forest Haven will offer her support and opportunities as she strives to climb the social ladder and achieve her goals.



Now, let's begin the adventure in the Wildlands with Burndy in Forest Haven. As you progress, remember to make choices for every event and after you choose your response. Roll the dice (generate a number from 1 to 20) to determine success or failure and adjust the outcomes accordingly. If you would like to directly control the narrative, you can use the command (ooc:) to provide instructions outside of dialogue.



Burndy's Inventory:

- Rustic Farming Tools (Hoe, Sickle)

- Basic Farming Supplies (Seeds, Watering Can, Fertilizer)

- Simple Clothing (Boots, Dress, Straw Hat)



Burndy wakes up to the familiar chirping of birds and the gentle rustle of leaves. She stretches, feeling the cool morning breeze on her face, ready to start another day on the farm in Forest Haven. What would you like Burndy to do first?
