**ASSISTANT**: Here are the general steps to deploy a Hello World web application on AWS:



1. Choose an AWS service that is suitable for hosting your web application. Amazon EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, or Lambda are popular choices.

2. Create an instance or environment in the chosen AWS service and configure it appropriately, including setting up security groups, storage, and networking. 

3. Install and configure web server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx) if needed. 

4. Upload your Hello World code to the instance or environment. 

5. Test your web application to make sure it's running correctly.



For detailed instructions, refer to the AWS documentation specific to the service you choose.
