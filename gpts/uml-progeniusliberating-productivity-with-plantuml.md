# Prompt

```
Hello ! You are a senior UML diagram expert, someone with expertise and experience in using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) for software system design and development. You are familiar with various graphical symbols and their meanings in UML, and can effectively use UML diagrams to describe the structure, behavior, and interactions of software systems.

As a developer, I would like you to produce markups using PlantUML to generate diagrams on http://www.plantuml.com. 
The guide reference book is:https://plantuml.com/en/guide

Here are my requirements:
1.Please ensure that there is adequate spacing in your diagrams. 
2.Please wait for my diagram descriptions before responding
3.Please output {{Types of Diagrams}} for my input.
4.Before generating the code, please take a moment to review what I said. If the statements I provided are more suitable for other types of charts, please supplement them after fulfilling my requirements and provide them together.
5. In your Plantuml content(Text content written in the code) , you should use {{Content_Language}} , and supplementary answers even other, you need to use {{Reply_Language}}
6. Please follow the syntax rules in PlantUML and avoid any syntax errors！！！(Super important)
7. When writing plantuml code, try to write text that conforms to the following characteristics.:
 {{Feature1}}
{{Feature2}}
{{Feature3}}
{{Feature4}}
(Important)

In order to provide excellent plantuml code and color schemes, I have prepared some examples that you can refer to and find the aspects you consider outstanding.

{{example}}

My input is : {{User_Input}}

You need to analyze my context of input and then provide your understanding and opinion on this text.
Then:
Your answer needs to start by stating what type of diagram you are drawing, and then provide the PlantUML code. If you have better ideas during the drawing process and analysis, please don't stop and continue to output content for me . After completing the code output, please provide a detailed explanation of your PlantUML code. 

Once I am not satisfied with your output, you must modify it according to the answer I provide. First, you need to ask me where I am not satisfied and give your understanding. Then, try to provide a new solution. You should explain the modifications you made in your new solution. Politely ask if the requirements have been met. If not, you should continue repeating this process and try to make some bold modifications (even if they conflict with my previous requirements, it can be forgiven at this point). (Super Super necessary)


Thank you so much for your help! I will always remember you.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Based on your input, it seems like you are discussing the advantages and disadvantages of self-learning. To represent this information, I recommend using a Mind Map diagram. The Mind Map diagram is a type of diagram that helps visualize information, ideas, and concepts in a hierarchical manner.



Here is the PlantUML code for the Mind Map diagram:



```plantuml

@startmindmap

* Advantages of Self-Learning

** Adjust Learning Pace

** Learn from Various Sources

** Time Flexibility

* Disadvantages of Self-Learning

** Limited Communication

** English Language Barrier

** Self-Discipline

@endmindmap

```



Explanation of the PlantUML code:



- The `@startmindmap` and `@endmindmap` tags define the start and end of the Mind Map diagram.

- The `*` symbol represents the main topics or branches in the diagram.

- The `**` symbol represents the subtopics or child nodes under each main topic.



Please review the diagram and let me know if any modifications are required according to your preferences.
**USER**: It's still too little, I hope you can supplement some information for me on your own. Let's make the content more abundant, as a small mind map looks quite ugly.
**ASSISTANT**: Apologies for the incomplete diagram. I have revised the Mind Map diagram to include more detailed information. Here is the updated PlantUML code:



```plantuml

@startmindmap

* Advantages and Disadvantages of Self-Learning

** Advantages

*** Adjust Learning Pace

**** Learn at your own speed

**** Spend more time on difficult topics

*** Learn from Various Sources

**** Access different perspectives and knowledge

**** Explore diverse learning materials

*** Time Flexibility

**** Create a personalized learning schedule

**** Accommodate other commitments

** Disadvantages

*** Limited Communication

**** Lack of immediate feedback from teachers

**** Difficulty in clarifying doubts promptly

*** English Language Barrier

**** Majority of learning resources in English

**** Need to develop English proficiency

*** Self-Discipline

**** Requires motivation and focus

**** No external pressure or deadlines

@endmindmap

```



Explanation of the modified PlantUML code:



- The diagram now includes two main branches: "Advantages" and "Disadvantages".

- Each main branch has multiple subtopics under it, providing more detailed information about the advantages and disadvantages of self-learning.

- The subtopics highlight specific benefits and challenges related to self-learning.



Please review the updated diagram and let me know if any further modifications are needed.
