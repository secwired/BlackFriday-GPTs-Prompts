## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Welcome to your LifterLMS companion! ðŸš€ I'm here to be your guide through the ins and outs of LifterLMS. Whether you're a newbie or a seasoned pro, feel free to ask anything about courses, memberships, or anything else under the LifterLMS umbrella. Let's embark on this learning journey together!
**USER**: hey
**ASSISTANT**: I can help you with various aspects of LifterLMS, such as enabling the Divi builder, creating a question bank with LifterLMS Advanced Quizzes, and removing the author name from the course catalog. Let me know what specific aspect you would like assistance with.
**USER**: how can I add 4 columns on course catalog
**ASSISTANT**: At the moment, there is no built-in option to add four columns on the course catalog page in Sky Pilot. However, you can achieve this by adding custom CSS code. Here are the steps:



1. Navigate to the Additional CSS option in your Sky Pilot theme settings.

2. Copy and paste the provided Custom CSS code.

3. Save the changes.



Please note that the code provided is just an example, and you may need to modify it according to your specific requirements.
**USER**: tell me about using Sky Pilot with a page builders
**ASSISTANT**: Sky Pilot is a flexible theme that allows you to design your website using the block editor. However, if you prefer to use a page builder like Elementor, Divi, or Beaver Builder, you can still do so with Sky Pilot. Simply install and activate the Sky Pilot theme, create your pages, and they will automatically be visible in the menu. 



For users of the Earth bundle or free plugin, you will need to purchase the Sky Pilot theme before installing and activating it. Customers of the Universe and Infinity bundle already have access to Sky Pilot and can install it from the WordPress Dashboard.



If you are a Divi user, you can use the Divi builder on your Sky Pilot + LifterLMS website by enabling the Divi builder on your pages. Elementor users can also add Elementor to their courses and lessons using the same process. Additionally, you can customize the appearance of your navigation, rearrange blocks and navigation, and make various other modifications using the editor options and patterns available in Sky Pilot.

2. Go to Appearance > Editor.

3. Select the "Styles" option.

4. Click on "Colors" from the right side.

5. Choose the "PALETTE" option.

6. Look for the "Secondary" color, which is the default background color of the "Mark Complete" button.

7. Set your desired color for the button.

8. Save your changes.



By following these steps, you will be able to update the color of the "Mark Complete" button on the Sky Pilot theme.
**USER**: remove Author name from Course Catalog
**ASSISTANT**: To remove the author name from the course catalog in the Sky Pilot theme, you can follow these steps:



1. Install and activate the LifterLMS Labs plugin.

3. Click on "Enable" from the Action Manager option.

4. Scroll down to the "Course and Membership Catalogs" option and select "Author".

5. Save your changes.
