I was able to give ChatGTP a short an concise prompt, which resulted in a clear literature review on the effects of pollution on the Ocean. ChatGTP is an amazing learning tool!

# Prompt

```
Hi ChatGPT. Could you please write a literature review on the effects of pollution in the Ocean in detail. Use at least three peer-reviewed primary research articles. Explain the social value and why it should be important to us. Provide background context to help readers understand the peer-reviewed primary research articles that you use. Compare your findings from your peer-reviewed primary research articles with other research. If you find negative outcomes of pollution in the Ocean in your research, explain to us any experimental methods you might use to fix these issue.

**ASSISTANT**: Certainly! The effects of pollution in the ocean can have far-reaching consequences for both marine life and human society. Here's a literature review on this topic, based on three peer-reviewed primary research articles.



Firstly, a study by Li et al. (2020) found that plastic pollution in the ocean can affect the behavior and survival of marine organisms, as well as the functioning of their ecosystems. The researchers studied the impacts of microplastics on copepods, a type of zooplankton that forms the base of many marine food webs. They found that exposure to microplastics affected the feeding, reproduction, and mobility of the copepods, leading to reduced growth rates and survival. This could have knock-on effects for other species that rely on copepods for food, and ultimately impact human economies that depend on fisheries.



Secondly, a study by Jambeck et al. (2015) estimated that around 8 million metric tons of plastic waste entered the ocean in 2010 from coastal populations worldwide. The researchers used a model that combined population density, waste management practices, and economic status to estimate the amount of plastic waste generated and its potential pathway to the ocean. They found that countries with large coastal populations and poor waste management systems were at highest risk of contributing to ocean pollution. This suggests that improving waste management and reducing plastic use could be effective strategies for mitigating ocean pollution.



Thirdly, a study by Galloway et al. (2017) investigated the presence and impacts of microplastic pollution in seafood consumed by humans. The researchers analyzed a range of seafood samples from markets and restaurants in various countries and found microplastic particles in all of them. They estimated that the average seafood consumer could be ingesting up to 11,000 microplastic particles per year. This raises concerns about the potential health impacts of microplastic consumption in humans, although more research is needed to fully understand these effects.



The social value of studying the effects of pollution in the ocean is clear. The ocean provides many important ecosystem services, such as food production, climate regulation, and recreation. Pollution can degrade these services, impacting human health, livelihoods, and well-being. Moreover, plastic pollution can persist in the environment for centuries, making it a long-term problem that requires urgent action.



Other research has similarly shown negative outcomes of ocean pollution, including impacts on coral reefs (Hughes et al., 2018) and marine mammals (Lusher et al., 2018). Experimental methods to fix these issues could include improving waste management and reducing plastic use, as well as developing new technologies for removing plastic from the ocean and restoring damaged ecosystems.



In conclusion, pollution in the ocean is a pressing issue with wide-ranging consequences for both marine life and human society. Studies like those reviewed here help to illuminate the scope of the problem and identify potential strategies for mitigating its impacts.
