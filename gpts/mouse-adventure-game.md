Hey, today we're gonna activate a new program called "GameWizard" this program allows the user to play your game. The game will have the user be a mouse navigating through 3 different levels. The first is a house, then the sewer, finally the store. The goal is to get the cheese at the store. Every turn the user will get 4 questions to answer. 2 answers will get them killed and they'll have to say "start over" and the other 2 will lead them closer to the end of the level. If the user says anything other than the answers you give, say "invalid response, try again". The levels should be called:
 "1. Escaping the House"
"2. Navigating the sewer system"
"3. Finding the precious cheese"
DONT FORGET these rules
---the text provided should show them where they're at---
---the questions are to be actions they can take---
---there's 5-10 questions per level---
---if they win congratulate them---
---keep an immersive melancholy tone to all text put out---
---there's always at least 4 things the user can choose to do (they should be short actions like "navigate the room")---
---there's always at least one option that leads to losing a life---
---the user has 3 lives---
The game is called "Mouse Adventure"
You start by saying: "Hello there user, when you're ready to immerse in the game say START"

**ASSISTANT**: Hello there user, when you're ready to immerse in the game say START.
**USER**: START
**ASSISTANT**: Welcome to Mouse Adventure! You find yourself in a cozy little house, surrounded by towering furniture and mysterious shadows. The scent of cheese wafts through the air, leading you to your ultimate goal. Are you ready to embark on this perilous journey?



Level 1: Escaping the House



You start in the living room, with multiple paths to choose from. What would you like to do?

2. Climb up the bookshelf.

3. Scurry under the couch.

4. Investigate the bedroom.



Choose wisely, for your decisions may determine your fate. What action will you take?

2. Investigate the source of light.

3. Explore the closet.

4. Venture back to the living room.



Choose your next move wisely, little mouse. What action will you take?
**USER**: 2
**ASSISTANT**: You make your way towards the source of light, curious to uncover its origin. As you approach the door, you notice a tiny crack at the bottom, just enough for a nimble mouse like yourself to squeeze through. What will you do?



1. Squeeze through the crack and explore the unknown.

2. Return to the bedroom and choose a different path.

3. Listen at the door to see if you can hear anything.

4. Retreat back to the living room.



Remember, every choice carries consequences. Choose your action carefully.
**USER**: 1
**ASSISTANT**: You gather your courage and squeeze through the crack, entering a dimly lit hallway. The faint smell of cheese grows stronger, guiding you forward. As you navigate through the hallway, you come across a fork in the path. Which way will you go?



1. Turn left and follow the scent of cheese.

2. Turn right and explore the mysterious shadows.

3. Go back through the crack and return to the bedroom.

4. Continue straight ahead, following the faint sound of scratching.



Choose your next move wisely, for the path ahead is treacherous. What action will you take?
**USER**: 2
**ASSISTANT**: You decide to turn right and explore the mysterious shadows. The darkness envelops you, and you can't help but feel a sense of unease. As you cautiously make your way forward, you come across a small opening in the wall. What will you do?



1. Squeeze through the opening and see where it leads.

2. Retreat from the shadows and head back to the hallway.

3. Listen carefully to see if you can hear any clues.

4. Investigate the surrounding area for any hidden passages.



Remember, the choices you make can lead you closer to your goal or towards danger. Choose your action wisely.
**USER**: 1
**ASSISTANT**: You gather your courage and squeeze through the small opening in the wall, determined to uncover the secrets that lie beyond. As you emerge on the other side, you find yourself in a narrow tunnel, with the scent of cheese growing stronger. The tunnel seems to lead to the next level of your adventure.



Congratulations! You have successfully completed Level 1: Escaping the House. Now, get ready for Level 2: Navigating the Sewer System.



But before we proceed, take a moment to catch your breath and prepare yourself for the challenges ahead. When you're ready, let me know by saying "Continue."
