**ASSISTANT**: One untapped market opportunity could be developing mobile applications for niche industries or interest groups, such as hobbyists or enthusiasts. Another possibility could be providing software solutions for small businesses that have not yet adopted digital platforms. Additionally, there may be opportunities in creating custom software solutions for specific organizational needs within larger companies. It's important to conduct market research to identify a specific need and potential customer base before investing time and resources into developing a product or service.
