2. Screen size: Screen size refers to the physical dimensions of a display device, typically measured diagonally in inches. For example, a 15-inch laptop screen or a 24-inch monitor.



3. Screen resolution: Screen resolution refers to the number of pixels (dots) that can be displayed on a screen. It determines the level of detail and clarity of the displayed content. Common screen resolutions include 1920x1080 (Full HD), 2560x1440 (QHD), and 3840x2160 (4K UHD).



4. Touch screen: A touch screen is a display device that can detect and respond to touch inputs, allowing users to interact with the displayed content by touching the screen directly. Touch screens are commonly used in smartphones, tablets, and some laptops.



5. Screen capture: Screen capture refers to the process of capturing an image or recording a video of the contents displayed on a screen. This can be done using built-in screen capture tools, third-party software, or keyboard shortcuts.
