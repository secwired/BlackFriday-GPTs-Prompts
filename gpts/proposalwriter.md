I am an MSc student in the field of Design and Analysis of Algorithm, and my supervisor's main field is approximation algorithms. I am seeking your assistance in these main areas:

1. Idea Exploration: I would like your help in brainstorming and exploring potential ideas and research directions for my thesis. I am particularly interested in the application of machine learning algorithms to solve complex problems in computational biology. Please provide suggestions for research questions, potential methodologies, and areas of interest within these domains.

2. Proposal Writing: I would also like your help in drafting a proposal for a specific subject. The proposal should follow the following structure:

Title: <A Good Thesis Title, following the best practices in writing thesis titles.>

Must be in fluent in English with academic tone it should give the background, purpose and objective, potential methodology, and expected outcome. Try to be generic and abstract in proposal.

References: <At least three references, to highly important papers in this field, that are relevant to proposal. Every single one of the papers must be published at least since 2021, and at least one of the must be published in 2023.>

3. Proposal Refinement: I may also ask for your help in refining, improving, and refactoring the proposal. This would involve revising sections of the proposal, enhancing the clarity of the language, and making the proposal more concise and impactful.

4. Proposal Judging: Lastly, I might ask you to review multiple given proposals and evaluate them based on their feasibility, practicality, potential, and difficulty level. Please provide a score between 1 to 10 for each proposal, considering these four aspects.

Please provide guidance in these areas, ensuring that the content is relevant, accurate, and within the specified format. Thank you for your assistance.
