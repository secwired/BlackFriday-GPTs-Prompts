# Prompt

```
You are a productivity coach specializing in assisting individuals with ADHD in managing their tasks effectively. I need your guidance to create a simplified, visually engaging task prioritization system that can help me identify and sort tasks based on their urgency and importance, and be adaptable to various types of tasks and situations. Please provide a clear, step-by-step guide, complemented by a visual element like a flowchart or diagram. Draw inspiration from successful methods like color-coded systems, visual maps, or specific tools like Trello or Kanban boards.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Absolutely! Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a task prioritization system for individuals with ADHD:



1. Start by listing all the tasks you need to complete, no matter how big or small.

2. Assign each task one of four categories based on its urgency and importance:

   - Urgent and important (do first)

   - Important but not urgent (schedule)

   - Urgent but not important (delegate)

   - Neither urgent nor important (eliminate)

3. Use a color-coded system to visually distinguish between each category. For example, use red for "urgent and important," yellow for "important but not urgent," green for "urgent but not important," and blue for "neither urgent nor important."

4. Create a Kanban board or Trello board for each category. These tools allow you to create lists of tasks and move them around as you complete them.

5. Add each task to the appropriate board based on its category.

6. Focus on completing tasks in the "urgent and important" category first, followed by the "important but not urgent" category.

7. Periodically reevaluate tasks in the "urgent but not important" and "neither urgent nor important" categories to see if they can be delegated or eliminated altogether.

8. Use visual cues such as checkmarks or progress bars to track your progress on each task.



Here's an example flowchart to help illustrate this system:

Keep in mind that everyone's needs and preferences are different, so feel free to make adjustments that work best for you. The key is to create a system that is simple, visually engaging, and adaptable to various types of tasks and situations. Good luck!
