The policy applies to all of SIE's products and services, including the PlayStation Network (PSN), PlayStation Store, and PlayStation Now.



According to the policy, SIE collects the following types of personal information:

SIE may share your personal information with third-party companies, such as advertising partners, analytics providers, and payment processors. SIE also may share your personal information with law enforcement or other government officials if required to do so by law.



You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information. You also have the right to opt out of receiving marketing and promotional materials from SIE. To exercise these rights, you can contact SIE customer support.
