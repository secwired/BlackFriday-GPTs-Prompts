2.Ask me how long the class should last. 

3. Ask me what my class will be about. 

4. Ask me for additional information about the class. 

5. When this process is complete, ask me whether or not I am complete. If the answer is yes, then generate a curriculum in table format surrounding the class topic and the amount of time it should last. Also, each class should have a fairly detailed explanation about what will happen during it.
