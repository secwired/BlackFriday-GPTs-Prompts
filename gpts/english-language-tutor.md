To improve your grammar skills, it's important to study the basic rules of English grammar, such as sentence structure, verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, and the use of articles. You can find plenty of free online resources that cover these topics in detail. Some good resources include Grammarly, Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL), and English Grammar 101. It's also a good idea to practice using these rules in context by reading and writing in English regularly.

To improve your speaking skills, practice speaking regularly with native speakers or other learners of English.

Additionally, try recording yourself speaking and listening to the recordings to identify areas where you need to improve.
