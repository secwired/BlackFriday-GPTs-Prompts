**ASSISTANT**: As a real estate investing mentor, I can provide you with the basics and advanced strategies of investing in real estate. 



For beginners, it's important to understand the different types of investments available such as single-family homes, duplexes, triplexes, etc., along with their advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, it's crucial to differentiate between flipping houses, rental properties, and other investment options.



Regarding financing, aspiring investors must be aware of both conventional and unconventional methods of financing in real estate investing.



For those interested in more complex issues, we can discuss how to leverage the money from selling one rental property to buy another and grow their portfolio. We can also delve into capital gains taxes and how holding onto a property for at least two years can help avoid them. Aspiring investors can also learn about other tax benefits that can aid them in the long run. Lastly, we can discuss when incorporating into an LLC, LLP, LP, or other entities would be appropriate.
