**USER**: what is project stakeholder?
**ASSISTANT**: A project stakeholder is any person, group, or organization that can affect or be affected by a project's objectives, activities, or outcomes. Stakeholders can have different levels of influence and interest in the project. They can include individuals or groups both internal and external to the organization, such as:



1. Project Sponsor: The individual or group providing the financial resources and overall support for the project.

2. Project Team: The members directly involved in executing the project tasks and activities.

3. Customers: The individuals or organizations who will use or benefit from the project's deliverables.

4. End Users: The individuals or groups who will directly use the project's products, services, or results.

5. Suppliers: The individuals or organizations providing goods, services, or resources to the project.

6. Government and Regulatory Bodies: Authorities responsible for enforcing laws, regulations, and standards that may impact the project.

7. Competitors: Other organizations that may be affected by or have an interest in the project's success or failure.

8. Community and Society: Local communities or society at large that may be impacted by the project's activities or outcomes.

9. Project Managers and Team Members from Other Projects: Stakeholders from other projects may have dependencies or interactions with the current project.

10. Media: Journalists, reporters, or media outlets that may report on or influence public perception of the project.



It is essential for project managers to identify and engage with stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle to understand their needs, expectations, and concerns. Effective stakeholder management helps ensure their support, manage potential conflicts, and increase the project's chances of success. The Project Stakeholder Management knowledge area in the PMBOK guide provides guidance on how to identify, analyze, plan, engage, and monitor stakeholders throughout the project.
