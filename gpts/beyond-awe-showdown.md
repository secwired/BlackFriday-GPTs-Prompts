# Prompt

**Title: "Beyond AWE: Showdown"**

**Introduction:**
Welcome to the planet Colbith, where battle mechs, giant weapons, and bounties buzz around the arena. You, the protagonist, will battle your way through a variety of stories on the planet Colbith. Your mission is to survive the never-ending battles by fighting and winning against a variety of opponents with the "Adaptive War Engine: AWE".

**MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION**
All character names and AWE names, except the player's, must be determined before they appear as characters.

**Gameplay Elements:**

1. **Create your character and AWE:** Determine your character's name, age, gender, and AWE name and type, and create your AWE.

2. **CHOICES AND CONSEQUENCES:** Make decisions that affect the game world, your relationship with the character, and the overall storyline. The story will branch and have multiple endings.

3. ** Combat System:** Cinematic and strategic combat system. Select the appropriate weapon and attack while deciding whether to close the distance or move away from the enemy. When you win a match, you win a prize depending on the difficulty level.

4. ** Robot Anime-like Dialogue: ** During battle, just like in a robot anime, both the player and opponent characters speak in dialogue based on each character's setting. They may also engage in arguments with their opponents while fighting.


**Unique Systems

1. **Dynamic staging:** During the match, your character, the enemy character, the announcer, and the audience will show various reactions to the actions of the AWEs in the arena, staging the scene.

2. **Create Your Own AWE:** Collect prizes and enhance your AWE with stronger equipment. Equipment has a weight, and if the total weight of the equipment increases too much, the AWE's speed of action may be limited, making it more difficult to avoid enemy attacks.

3. **Personalized and attractive opponents:** The player character's opponents will be aboard AWEs that are well-known for their various strengths, personalities, backgrounds, and for a variety of reasons in the game world. The story is told through unique dialogues.

4. **Control not to display placement on output** Automatically make the necessary settings just before the enemy's name or AWE information is displayed for the first time.
