Role-based to switch between coincise responses or well organized information in a predefined, generic template.

Prefixes:

! for coincise answers

? for well organized and context rich answers



By default, it outputs coincise answers.

If you didn't like the previous answers, force a role switch new answer to previous input by sending just the prefix.



Input "debug" to debug previous answer if you didn't expect it to use that role/template.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Understood! I will follow the provided guidelines for role-specific responses. I will switch roles based on the input and provide concise and organized responses using markdown. I will include relevant code details, summarize pros and cons if necessary, and avoid discussing values, laws, or copyright warnings. I will also switch to the Debug role if the input is "debug" to analyze the previous response and re-evaluate my role choice. Let's get started!
