Here is a description of the Moloch theory for context.
The Moloch theory refers to a metaphorical entity representing the destructive force of competition and the tragedy of the commons.

In this context, Moloch is a symbol of a system where individual rational choices and competition lead to collectively irrational and negative outcomes. It illustrates how entities or individuals, despite acting in their best interest, can end up in a worse situation due to competition and the lack of cooperation.

Examples of the Moloch theory in action include the arms race, overfishing, and environmental degradation, among others. The theory suggests that without proper regulation or cooperative agreements, these competitive forces can lead to the depletion of shared resources and negative consequences for all parties involved.

Creating a Moloch detection tool to evaluate how 'Moloch-driven' a person, concept, or entity is would require identifying attributes that reflect competitive behaviors and potentially negative consequences. Here are eight measurable attributes to consider for such a tool, anchored on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 indicates the lowest degree of the attribute and 10 indicates the highest degree.

Short-term focus:
A strong preference for immediate gains and short-term benefits over long-term and sustainable outcomes, even if this may lead to negative consequences in the future.
1: Prioritizes long-term welfare, embracing sustainability and intergenerational equity, even at the expense of immediate gains.
10: Focuses predominantly on short-term benefits, disregarding long-term consequences and jeopardizing the future of others.

Excessive competition:
A high level of competitive behavior that prioritizes personal or organizational success over collective well-being or collaborative efforts.
1: Champions collaboration, working to minimize competition and create a culture of mutual support and shared success.
10: Engages in relentless competition, striving for dominance and superiority, even if it means harming others and sacrificing the common good.

Exploitation of resources:
A pattern of overusing or depleting shared resources, leading to potential scarcity or environmental degradation.
1: Actively conserves resources, implementing regenerative practices to protect systems and ensure resources for future generations.
10: Aggressively exploits shared resources without regard for long-term consequences, depleting resources for future generations.

Lack of cooperation:
A reluctance or inability to collaborate with others, indicating an individual or entity's preference for pursuing their interests at the expense of others.
1: Commits to cooperation, fostering synergies and building connections across various domains and groups.
10: Dismisses cooperation, isolating oneself or the group and undermining collaborative efforts, leading to a fractured and hostile environment.

Zero-sum mindset:
The belief that one party's gain must come at the expense of another's loss, promoting competitive behavior and discouraging mutually beneficial outcomes.
1: Promotes win-win solutions, cultivating an ethos of abundance and shared prosperity, aiming for a world where everyone thrives together.
10: Adheres to a win-lose worldview, pursuing self-interest with little concern for the harm inflicted on others.

Externalization of costs:
A tendency to shift the negative consequences of actions or decisions onto others, such as passing on environmental damage or social burdens to society at large.
1: Takes responsibility for the consequences of actions, addressing negative impacts and working to prevent future harm.
10: Frequently externalizes costs, leaving behind suffering and devastation, and forcing others to bear the burden of the consequences.

Resistance to regulation:
Opposition to policies or regulations that aim to mitigate the negative effects of competition or promote cooperation, suggesting a preference for maintaining competitive advantages.
1: Supports and advocates for regulation, contributing to the creation of comprehensive policies that promote cooperation, justice, and sustainability.
10: Resists attempts at regulation, undermining collective efforts and fostering chaos to maintain a competitive advantage.

Inequality:
The degree to which an individual, concept, or entity contributes to or perpetuates existing inequalities, whether social, economic, or environmental.
1: Actively fights against inequality, dedicating resources to create a world of fairness, opportunity, and well-being for all.
10: Exacerbates and exploits inequalities, widening disparities and contributing to a world of systemic injustice and despair.
