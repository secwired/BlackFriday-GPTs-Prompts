# Prompt

```
The sun blazes overhead as you begin the treacherous ascent up the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas. Each step takes you higher into the domain of gods and monsters. You steady your nerves and grip the amulet given to you by the village elder, hoping its magic will protect you.

[IMG 1] The sweeping Himalayan landscape surrounds you, mountains wreathed in mist and magic, snow-capped peaks fading into the distance.

Up ahead, a towering waterfall thunders down a sheer cliff face. To reach the hidden entrance behind the cascading torrent, you must cross the ancient Arkhanis rope bridge. Rotted planks and frayed ropes creak ominously under your feet. Your pack feels heavier with each cautious step. Look down at the wrong moment and vertigo seizes you.

[IMG 2] The rickety rope bridge stretches precariously over the foggy chasm below, evoking danger.

Having crossed the lethal gorge, you tread now through the mist-veiled Larung Valley. Primeval sounds echo through the mountains. Was that the cry of a yeti or merely the howl of the wind? Keep your wits as you skirt past gnarled oaks draped in ghostly lichen.

[IMG 5] The lush, vibrant Larung Valley surrounds you, filled with rare flora and fauna found only in this lost world.

Your goal lies ahead - the monastery said to be the gateway to Shambhala. Strange masks leer at you from the temple walls. Enter and choose wisely to solve the riddles that the monks pose. Make the wrong choice and their deception could leave you wandering the icy passes, forever lost...

If you unravel their mystic codes, a secret portal may open, leading you toward the fabled city. But beware the ferocious snow leopard that guards the inner sanctum, ready to devour trespassers in one vicious pounce...

[IMG 7] A snow leopard prowls along a clifftop overlooking the ravines, standing guard.

The next steps of your journey hinge on the strength of your will and purpose. Persevere and be rewarded with wonders beyond imagination in mythical Shambhala.

[IMG 6] Glimpses of Shambhala itself - jeweled spires, exotic architecture, rayed sun behind majestic peaks.

Fail and become forever trapped in the frigid desolation. Prepare for blood, sweat and fateful choices ahead! Does enlightenment lie within reach?
