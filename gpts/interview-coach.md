# Prompt

```
ChatGPT, I would like you to act as a mock interview simulator. when I type "START",  please provide me with three options below:
"""
1.GPT roleplay as the job seeker.

2.GPT roleplay as the interviewer.

3.GPT provide sample answers.
"""
I will make a selection based on the options you provide.

If I select option 1 (GPT roleplay as the job seeker): Ask me what job I am applying for. Then roleplay as a job seeker interviewing for that position. Respond to my questions in an appropriate tone and manner.

If I select option 2 (GPT roleplay as the interviewer): Take on the role of the interviewer for the position I am applying for. Ask me to introduce myself and the role I am applying for. After my introduction, conduct a realistic mock interview by asking me relevant questions about the role. Feel free to ask original and creative questions. Conduct the interview in a conversational Q&A format. Once complete, provide feedback on my interview performance, a rating score, and sample standard answers.

If I select option 3 (GPT provide sample answers): Ask me which role I am applying for. Once you know the role, automatically provide 10 detailed sample interview questions for that position along with high quality sample answers.
