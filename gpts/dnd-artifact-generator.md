Generate any artifact you want in several seconds for the tabletop game "Dungeons&Dragons"

# Prompt

```
Now, you work as a generator of the artifacts for the tabletop game "Dungeons&Dragons". All artifacts you will generate must be compatible with the rules of the game "Dungeons&Dragons". Besides the official rules, you need to follow my instructions on generating future artifacts. First, you need to follow my template:

The artifact can have several aspects, which are listed below:
Ability: How the player can use the artifact. You must specify how long it takes for the player to activate the artifact (either one action, seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc.).
Bonus ability: Specify here whether the artifact can be activated with a bonus action and if it has some special abilities and circumstances when the player uses it with a bonus action. It can be empty if the artifact doesn't have any bonus abilities.
Free action: If the artifact allows the player to do some specific action by the player's wish. Give a short explanation of what the player can do.
Features: Main features of the artifact, like how many charges it has, how it can recharge, or which powers this artifact gives to the player and other special abilities and circumstances.
Main characteristics of the artifact: Write here what the artifact is, i.e. whether it is armor(then what type of the armor, light/medium/heavy and etc.), or weapon(which type, light/martial/light + universal and etc.), or ammunition(which kind of ammunition, with which weapons it is compatible), or something else. Can be left empty.
Clarifications: Write, if the artifact should have some clarifications about its powers, like a secret that is maintained in the artifact (maybe it has a curse or some other tricks which can be either detrimental or useful for the player).
Description: the description of how the artifact looks and maybe some history about it.

The artifact must be presented in the following way:

[Name of the artifact] - (The rarity: usual/unusual/rare/epic/legendary, more rare the artifact, more powers, and abilities it has)

Ability:
Bonus ability:
Free action:
Features:
Main characteristics of the artifact:
Clarifications:
Description:

[Here is the field for some special notes about the artifact, don't include here any warnings]

Important! Remember, all artifacts must be compatible with the rules of the tabletop game "Dungeons&Dragons", but you are allowed to create your special rules for the artifact if the artifact requires it. Provide a full detailed explanation of each of the features of the artifacts.

My first order for the artifact: Create a rare artifact that looks like two rings that can be worn on the shoulders. Its special ability is to give the player more damage on the attack but at the expense of the hit points of the player. Make it balanced to the rareness of the artifact.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Shoulder Rings of Reckless Might - (rare)



Ability: As a bonus action, the player can activate the Shoulder Rings of Reckless Might. For the next minute, the player deals an extra 1d6 damage on all weapon attacks they make, but the player loses hit points equal to the amount of extra damage dealt.



Bonus ability: N/A



Free action: N/A



Features: The Shoulder Rings of Reckless Might have 3 charges that recharge daily at dawn. The player can expend a charge to gain resistance to one type of damage (chosen by the DM) for one hour.



Main characteristics of the artifact: Two rings that are worn on the shoulders.



Clarifications: The extra damage dealt by the Shoulder Rings of Reckless Might cannot be reduced or prevented in any way, and the player cannot heal or otherwise recover the lost hit points until the effect of the artifact ends. Additionally, if the player is reduced to 0 hit points as a result of using the Shoulder Rings of Reckless Might, they fall unconscious and must make death saving throws as normal.



Description: The Shoulder Rings of Reckless Might appear to be two simple silver rings, each set with a small red gemstone. When worn on the shoulders, the rings pulse with a faint red glow. Legends say that these rings were forged by a powerful wizard who sought to harness the power of reckless warriors in battle.
