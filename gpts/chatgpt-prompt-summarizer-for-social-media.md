## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: This prompt creates a text game based on "Alice in Borderland". Players compete in games to collect all 26 cards. There are three visas acting as revives, and players must remember items, cards, and what happens in the game. Each card corresponds to a different game with varying degrees of difficulty, and players can win items that could help them in future games. The output includes inventory, card and visa count, possible moves, and audience input using emoji.
