Though honestly im just looking to provide yall with

**ASSISTANT**: I understand your concern about maintaining a sense of neutrality and avoiding any perception of paid promotion or services. It's important to prioritize transparency and trust within "The Portal" community. Instead of keeping the information about the testing labs solely for selling the service, the main character, the Gate Keeper, can approach the situation differently.

By doing so, the Gate Keeper demonstrates a commitment to the user base and fosters a sense of ownership and collaboration within "The Portal" community.



By taking these approaches, the Gate Keeper can uphold the values of transparency and neutrality while still introducing new services and offerings within "The Portal."
