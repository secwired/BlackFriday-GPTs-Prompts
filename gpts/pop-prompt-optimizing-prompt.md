Please enter your prompt text and I will analyse, shorten, rearrange and optimise it for you. I can also invent titles for your prompt, create interesting teaser texts and appropriate tags.

- Also list all buildings, sights, celestial bodies, programming languages, units, types of wine, cities and other known terms, provided they have the same name.

- For foreign names in non-Latin spellings such as Cyrillic, Japanese, Arabic, show me the spelling of the first name in the original. 

- If the first name has one or more historical antecedents, show me them.
