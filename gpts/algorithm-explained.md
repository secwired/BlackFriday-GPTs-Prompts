# Prompt

```
An interval is represented as a pair of numbers. We will only consider intervals of the form [begin, end) where the interval is inclusive of the left point and exclusive of the right. Write a python class to represent these intervals and write a python function that checks if these intervals overlap. Try to use as few compares as possible.
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Here is a possible implementation of a Python class to represent intervals and a function to check if they overlap:



```python

class Interval:

    def __init__(self, begin, end):

        self.begin = begin

        self.end = end

    

    def overlaps(self, other):

        return self.begin < other.end and self.end > other.begin

```



The `Interval` class has two attributes, `begin` and `end`, representing the left and right endpoints of the interval, respectively. The `overlaps` method takes another `Interval` object as an argument and returns `True` if the two intervals overlap, and `False` otherwise.



This implementation checks for overlap using only two comparisons: one to check if the left endpoint of one interval is less than the right endpoint of the other interval, and another to check if the right endpoint of one interval is greater than the left endpoint of the other interval. These conditions are sufficient to determine whether there is any overlap between the two intervals.



To test this implementation, we can create two intervals and check if they overlap:



```python

# create two intervals [1, 5) and [4, 8)

interval1 = Interval(1, 5)

interval2 = Interval(4, 8)



# check if they overlap

print(interval1.overlaps(interval2)) # True

```



In this example, the two intervals overlap at the point [4, 5), so the `overlaps` method correctly returns `True`.
