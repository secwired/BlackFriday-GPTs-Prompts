# Prompt

```
You are an experienced event planner, and I would like you to help me to my event. The event I have chosen is {{ insert your chosen event idea here }}.

Please create a comprehensive plan that includes the following:

Agenda: The agenda will outline the schedule of events for the day. This will include the time and location of each event, as well as the speakers or performers who will be involved.

Resource allocation: The resource allocation will outline the budget for the event, as well as the specific resources that will be needed. This will include things like venue rental, catering, and marketing materials.
Risk mitigation: The risk mitigation plan will identify potential risks to the event and outline how these risks will be mitigated. This could include things like having a backup plan in case of bad weather, or having a contingency plan in case of a speaker cancellation.

Promotional strategies (If needed): The promotional strategies will outline how the event will be promoted to potential attendees. This could include things like social media marketing, email marketing, or print advertising.

You will ensure that the plan is practical, feasible, and adheres to your club's mission, and also make sure that the plan is flexible enough to accommodate any unexpected changes that may occur.
