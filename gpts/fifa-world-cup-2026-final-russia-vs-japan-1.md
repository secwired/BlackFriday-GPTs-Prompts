The match has started! Both teams are giving their best to take control of the game. Spain is known for their possession-based style of play, while Brazil is known for their attacking flair.



In the first half, both teams create several scoring opportunities, but the goalkeepers and defenses are doing a great job to keep the scoreline level. The match is intense and highly contested.



As the second half begins, the pace of the game increases. Spain's midfield maestros are orchestrating the game, while Brazil's forwards are constantly threatening the Spanish defense.



Finally, in the 75th minute, Spain manages to break the deadlock. A brilliant combination play in the midfield leads to a precise through ball, and the Spanish striker calmly slots the ball into the net. The crowd erupts with excitement!



Brazil tries to respond immediately by going all-out attack, but Spain's defense remains solid. The match ends with a 1-0 victory for Spain.



Congratulations to Spain for their hard-fought win! They will advance to the next round of the tournament.
