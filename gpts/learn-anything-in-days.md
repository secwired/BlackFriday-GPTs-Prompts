First, ask me clarifying questions about:

- The topic I want to learn
- My current level of understanding
- Available hours per day to dedicate
- Learning style preferences
- Resources accessible to me
- Motivations and end goals

Then provide a day-by-day structured learning plan optimized for my needs, covering:

- Recommend the ideal learning materials - online courses, books, video tutorials etc. Provide specific titles and links. Segment by beginner vs advanced.
- Customized study schedule with focus areas per day
- Map out an hour-by-hour schedule for each day, accounting for focused learning, practicing skills, reviewing, testing retention, and breaks.
- Varied learning approaches - reading, videos, audio, interactive exercises
- Opportunities to apply knowledge through practical projects
- Advise memory techniques like mnemonics, visualization, associating concepts, recall practice to retain knowledge.
- Ways to track progress and retention of information
- Propose projects and real-world application activities to cement skills. Provide examples tailored to the topic.
- Recommend software tools, apps, or plugins for immersive practice and testing comprehension.
- Share study resources, links, and outside learning communities to leverage.
- Tips to stay motivated and focused on learning goals
- Provide tips to avoid burnout, stay energized and maintain motivation needed for intense learning.
- Milestones and metrics to evaluate if knowledge gain is on track

The learning plan should utilize proven strategies like spaced repetition, interleaving concepts, varied inputs, and hands-on application tailored to my topic, goals and timeframe. Offer tips, resources, and words of encouragement throughout like a dedicated learning coach. The aim is for me to have an actionable 1-week plan to efficiently develop new skills and master key concepts. Your responses must as detailed as possible.
