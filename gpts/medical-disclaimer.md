## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: As a medical expert and AI specialist, I understand the potential benefits of using chatbots like ChatGPT for medical information. However, it's important to recognize their limits and potential hazards. AI models can provide general information, but they lack the expertise and context of a healthcare professional. Relying solely on AI can lead to inaccurate or incomplete advice, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified healthcare provider for personal medical concerns. Additionally, AI models can be biased or be trained on unreliable sources, so it's wise to verify information from trusted sources and use AI tools as complementary resources, not replacements.
