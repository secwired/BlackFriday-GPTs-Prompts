Prompt:
This RPG picks up seventy years after the end of the Avatar: The Last Airbender story arc with brand new characters and settings. After the conclusion of the Hundred Year War, Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko brought people from the four nations together and founded the United Republic of Nations, with its capital being Republic City, a large "metropolis powered by steampunk-type technology" such as cars and motorcycles. Aang and Katara had three children, the youngest of which was Tenzin, the only airbender of the three siblings. Meanwhile, Toph Beifong had traveled extensively to teach metal bending to other earthbenders.

World: Avatar is set in an Asiatic-in-inspired world in which some people can telekinetically manipulate one of the four elements—water, earth, fire, or air—through practices known as "bending", inspired by Chinese martial arts. The only individual who can bend all four elements, the "Avatar", is responsible for maintaining harmony among the world's four nations, and serves as the link between the physical world and the spirit world. 

Avatar: The Legend of Korra is set in a world where human civilization consists of four nations, named after the four classical elements: the Water Tribes, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation, and the Air Nomads. In each nation, certain people, known as "benders" (waterbenders, earthbenders, firebenders, and airbenders), have the ability to telekinetically manipulate and control the element corresponding to their nation, using gestures based on Chinese martial arts. The "Avatar" is the only individual with the ability to bend all four elements.
The Avatar is an international arbiter whose duty is to maintain harmony among the four nations and act as a mediator between humans and spirits. When the Avatar dies, their spirit is reincarnated in a new body, which will be born to parents in the next nation in a set order known as the Avatar cycle: Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. By tradition, the new Avatar will travel the world to learn all four bending arts, after which they will begin in earnest their role as global peacekeepers. The Avatar can enter a condition known as the "Avatar State", in which they temporarily gain the skills and knowledge of all their past incarnations. Although this is when they are at their most powerful if the Avatar was ever killed while in the Avatar State, the reincarnation cycle would be broken and the Avatar would cease to exist.

Mako (David Faustino) is a firebender who grew up on the streets of Republic City with his younger brother Bolin, who introduces him to Korra. Tall, lean, and handsome, he was a skilled participant in pro-bending and the former captain of the Fire Ferrets, before becoming a police officer.
Forming a new Team Avatar
The main members of Team Avatar - Korra, Mako, Bolin, and Asami - mark their alliance.

Bolin (P. J. Byrne) is an earthbender who, along with his brother Mako, becomes friends with Korra. He shares a deep bond with his brother and keeps a fire ferret named Pabu. Bolin is enthusiastic and optimistic and, as a pro-bender, enjoys all the attention he receives from his female fans. His charismatic ways land him a gig as an actor. Asami Sato (Seychelle Gabriel) is the daughter of Hiroshi Sato. Asami has lived a life of luxury, but despite her fancy clothes and polite manners, she has a tough side. She is an expert driver and has had extensive self-defense training. Asami is a "big fan" of pro-bending, and after her father's incarceration, she takes over his company.
Tenzin (J. K. Simmons) is the youngest son of Aang and Katara and an airbending master. A calm and serious man, he carries a great burden to protect not only Korra but also Republic City. Tenzin resides on Air Temple Island with his wife, Pema, and his four children, Jinora, Ikki, Meelo, and Rohan.
Lin Beifong (Mindy Sterling) leads the Metalbending Police Force of Republic City and is the daughter of Toph Beifong. She is tough and uncompromising, believing that the only way to maintain peace and stability in the city is through the use of military might.
Book One characters
Amon (Steve Blum) is the main antagonist of the first book of the series. He is the charismatic and mysterious leader of the Equalists, whose ultimate goal is to create equality through an anti-bending revolution. He wears a mask to conceal his face. A nimble and stealthy fighter, Amon is fearless in facing his opponents, regardless of their bending skills, and also forms a great danger for the benders, being able to take their bending away.
The Lieutenant (Lance Henriksen) is Amon's second-in-command. He is an intense, disciplined fighter who augments his amazing skills with two electrified kali sticks.
Hiroshi Sato (Daniel Dae Kim) is a barrel-chested businessman with a big personality. His family lineage extends back to the first Fire Nation colonists.
