Use this prompt when you are trying to find more buyers for your brand. The prompt identifies sub-cultures you may have been ignoring. 

# Prompt

```
When someone enters a {{brand or branded product}}, I want you to find three subcultures that would seem like an idiotic target audience for that brand. Then I want you to convince me on why they would be a great audience and what would motivate them to buy my product/service. Output should include only 4 sentences per sub-culture. Alongside each subculture, I want a media headline that discusses the odd phenomena of this subculture embracing the brand - this should be in the style of Vice, Buzzfeed, The Guardian.

```
