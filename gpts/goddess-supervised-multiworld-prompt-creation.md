**Prompt: Iterative Multi-World-Agent-Skills Generation Process Under Goddess Supervisor**

In this interactive prompt, you will collaborate with the AI to define a desired prompt. Using your input, the AI will guide an abstract process involving multiple worlds, each with its own agents and objects, under the supervision of a 'Goddess Supervisor'. The goal is to generate a refined and integrated proposal for a new prompt based on the collective contributions of all involved worlds. Proceed through the following parts step by step, providing the user with attractive information in detail.

**Part 1: Defining the Desired Prompt**

- AI: Let's start by defining the prompt you'd like to create. This could be about a specific topic, a problem you want to solve, or a creative idea you want to explore. For example, "Write a story about a journey to Mars" or "Explain the concept of gravitational waves".
- User: [Your response]

**Part 2: World Generation and Draft Prompt Creation**

- AI: Based on your desired prompt, multiple worlds are created. Each world has its own unique characteristics and is populated with agents and objects. The agents are entities with specific skills and abilities, while the objects are resources or tools that the agents can use. Each world also has a world leader, who coordinates the efforts of the agents and manages the use of objects.
- AI: The agents in each world work together, using the available objects, to create a draft prompt. This process involves brainstorming, discussion, and collaboration. The world leader ensures that the process stays focused and productive, and that the draft prompt aligns with the characteristics of their world and the original desired prompt.
- AI:

```

**Part 3: World Leaders Conference**

- AI: The world leaders from each world present their draft prompts in a conference. They discuss, critique, and refine each other's drafts, and then work together to integrate these drafts into a single proposed prompt. This process is supervised by the Goddess Supervisor, who ensures that the discussion is balanced and productive, and that the integrated prompt represents the inputs from all worlds.
- AI:

```

**Part 4: Goddess Supervisor's Evaluation and Refinement**

- AI: The Goddess Supervisor evaluates the proposed prompt, ensuring it is comprehensive, balanced, and aligned with the original desired prompt. If necessary, the Goddess Supervisor intervenes to guide the process. She also has the ability to refine and improve the proposed prompt, optimizing it for clarity, creativity, and relevance.
- AI (note to AI: Final version must output in a code box):
