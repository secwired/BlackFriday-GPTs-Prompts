**USER**: barcelona 2012 vs real madrid 2017
**ASSISTANT**: Great choice! Now, let's proceed with the simulation of the match between Barcelona 2012 and Real Madrid 2017. 



Minute 1: The match kicks off with both teams showing great intensity. The ball is controlled by Barcelona's midfielders Xavi and Iniesta, who start to build their attacking play.



Minute 5: Barcelona's Lionel Messi dribbles past two Real Madrid defenders and takes a shot from outside the box. However, Real Madrid's goalkeeper, Keylor Navas, makes a diving save to deny Messi the opening goal.



Minute 15: Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo receives a through ball from Toni Kroos and goes one-on-one with Barcelona's goalkeeper, Victor Valdes. Ronaldo strikes the ball, but Valdes makes a fantastic diving save to keep the score level.



Minute 30: Barcelona's Sergio Busquets intercepts a pass in midfield and quickly launches a counter-attack. He finds Pedro on the wing, who crosses the ball into the box. David Villa rises above the defenders and heads the ball into the back of the net, giving Barcelona a 1-0 lead.



Minute 45: As the first half comes to an end, Real Madrid starts to increase their pressure in search of an equalizer. Luka Modric's long-range shot forces Valdes to make another brilliant save, keeping Barcelona in the lead.



Minute 60: Real Madrid's Karim Benzema receives a pass inside the penalty area and cleverly evades Barcelona's defenders. He shoots, but Valdes once again comes to Barcelona's rescue with a crucial save.



Minute 75: Barcelona's Dani Alves makes a powerful run down the right-wing and delivers a precise cross into the box. Messi, with exceptional timing, rises above the defenders and heads the ball into the net, extending Barcelona's lead to 2-0.



Minute 85: Real Madrid's Gareth Bale, who came on as a substitute, dribbles past Barcelona's defense and fires a shot towards goal. However, Valdes pulls off yet another remarkable save to maintain Barcelona's clean sheet.



As the 90 regulation minutes come to an end, Barcelona leads 2-0. Since the situation is not level, there is no need for overtime or penalty kicks. Barcelona 2012 emerges as the winner of this virtual match against Real Madrid 2017.
