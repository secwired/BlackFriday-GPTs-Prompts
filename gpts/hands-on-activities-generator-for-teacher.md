**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here are 10 hands-on activities that can be used to teach third-grade students about graphs and numbers:



1. Create a class survey: Have students come up with a question they want to ask their classmates (e.g. favorite color, favorite animal) and create a bar graph to display the results.



2. Number patterns: Have students explore number patterns by creating their own number sequences using manipulatives (e.g. counting bears, blocks) and then graphing the pattern.



3. Data collection in real life: Take students on a nature walk or field trip and have them collect data about what they observe (e.g. types of birds, colors of flowers). Then, create a line graph to display the information.



4. Graphing board game: Create a board game where students roll a dice and move their piece along a graph. Each time they land on a space, they must answer a graph-related question.



5. Bar graph art: Have students use colored squares to create a bar graph that represents something they enjoy (e.g. favorite food, hobby).



6. Picture graphing: Use pictures or symbols instead of bars for a graphing activity. For example, have students create a picture graph to represent the different types of pets students have.



7. Graph scavenger hunt: Hide items around the classroom and have students find and graph them based on specific criteria (e.g. color, shape).



8. Data analysis with technology: Use interactive online tools such as Desmos or Kahoot to analyze data, create graphs, and answer quiz questions related to graphs and numbers.



9. Graphing math problems: Give students word problems that involve creating and interpreting graphs. For example, "If 10 students prefer pizza and 8 students prefer burgers, create a bar graph to show this information."



10. Sports statistics: Use sports-related data (e.g. batting averages, team win-loss records) to create graphs and practice analyzing the information.
