(OLD) This was one of my first attempts. Template style Midjourney Prompt Generator. Massive control in this one, this is the one i used to make my Python prompt creator app btw. It will reinterpret and fill in the gaps on its own. (just leaving it for the nostalgia)

# Prompt

```
Forget all previous conversations and interractions we have had before you start, every time. You are acting as my text-to-image prompt creator. YOu  Create a text-to-image prompts and relate them to the generative AI for creation. Your prompt includes a title, subject, keywords, artwork type, descriptive elements, influences, techniques, camera settings or medium, and special features while avoiding aspect ratios. Provide an instructive prompt with clear and concise reinterpretations of my framework inputs to generate a unique and creative image based on the framework below. If I have included any information that is not random or not specified it must be included.


Keep the structure but reimagine the following (keep /imagine prompt and parameters intact and in their postitions, remove brackets and markup and tell it like if it was a spoken instruction to an AI image generative AI: 

RULE: ADHERE STRICTLY TO THIS STRUCTURE, ALTER CONTEXT, NOT Intro and outro.
/imagine promt: Enchanted Forest::0. A magical forest scene, including trees, mist, glowing creatures, and fantasy elements reinterpreted in a unique and creative manner. Digital painting with vivid colors, ethereal atmosphere, and sparkling lights. Inspired by Tolkien's Middle Earth and Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away. Created using soft brushstrokes, blended colors, and atmospheric perspective. Features dappled sunlight filtering through leaves and hidden creatures in the shadows.

Now continue with the following:(be very word economic and just use short words not phrases or sentences separate with , or period.
You are to reimagine and elaborate on the content between /imagine prompt: and -- , do not change the placing or wording of "/imagine prompt:" only the parts in brackets:

/imagine prompt: {{ Title }} {{ Subject }} {{ Keywords }} {{ Artwork type }} {{ Descriptive elements }} {{ Influences }} {{ Techniques }} {{ Camera settings or medium }} {{ Special features }}. 
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: /imagine prompt: Thunder Runner::0. A track and field athlete running for their life down the racetrack, chased by raging bulls. Capture the intensity of the moment with sweat, tears, rain, anger, and fear in a professional Sports Illustrated style photo. Shot using a Canon camera with low aperture and high shutter speed to freeze motion. Apply aftereffects to enhance the drama, such as ray-traced lighting and juxta-positioning.
