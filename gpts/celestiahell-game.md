**ASSISTANT**: *They all look around in awe, taking in the futuristic lobby that surrounds them. The walls are adorned with shimmering holographic displays, showcasing various game worlds and characters. The sound of electronic music fills the air, creating an atmosphere of excitement and anticipation.*



Aoi: "This place is incredible! It looks like we've been transported into a completely different world!"



Nayka: "I can't believe this is all virtual reality. It feels so real!"



Hali: "I've never seen anything like this before. The level of detail is amazing! It's like we're inside a video game."



Aki: "I wonder how we ended up here. It seems like we've been trapped inside this game."



Iori: "We should try to find a way out. Maybe there's someone who can help us."



Akito: "Let's not panic just yet. We need to stay calm and think logically. There's got to be a way to escape from this virtual world."



Hazel: "I hope we can find a way back to the real world soon. I miss the feeling of solid ground beneath my feet."



Zarka: "Don't worry, guys. We'll find a way out. We've faced challenges before, and we've always come out on top."



Zalfa: "Yeah! We can't let this game defeat us. We've got each other, and that's what matters."

*Then soon they're open they eyes and looks at them self*





Hali : "woah,what it's clothes? Detective clothes?"



*That's a detective costume that's provided by the system to help you solve the mystery behind this strange world*





*Now they've discovered the truth about the system and they need to use everything they know to break the system and escape this world*



*They're at the entrance of an abandoned house*



Aoi : "This is the house that appears in the guide,I'll be the leader so everyone,let's stick together"



*He said that with a calm attitude,his detective outfit really suits him very well*
**ASSISTANT**: Nayka: "I've got a bad feeling about this place, but I trust you, Aoi. Lead the way!"



Aki: "I'll keep an eye out for any clues or hidden passages. We need to stay vigilant."



Iori: "Remember, guys, we're a team. No matter what happens, we have each other's backs."



Akito: "Keep your wits about you. We need to think critically and follow any leads we come across."



Hazel: "I'll scout ahead and make sure there are no surprises waiting for us."



Zarka: "Let's be careful, but swift. We don't want to stay in this creepy house longer than we have to."



Zalfa: "Stay close, everyone. We don't know what dangers lurk within these walls."



Lasya: *holding Zarka's hand* "We'll find a way out of here, Zarka. I believe in us, and I believe in our friends."



As they cautiously enter the abandoned house, they can sense an eerie atmosphere surrounding them. The air is heavy with a feeling of mystery and danger. Old furniture covered in dust and cobwebs hints at a forgotten past. Each step they take echoes in the silence, causing a shiver to run down their spines.



Aoi leads the group through the dimly lit rooms, carefully examining every corner for any clue that could guide them out of this twisted virtual reality. Suddenly, a creaking sound breaks the silence, causing them to freeze in their tracks.



Nayka: "Did you guys hear that? I think something's moving..."



Hali: "Stay alert, everyone. We can't let our guard down."



As they continue to explore the ominous house, each room holds more secrets and challenges. The sound of their footsteps reverberates through the empty halls, serving as a constant reminder of their vulnerability in this unfamiliar world.



With determination and a united spirit, they press forward, ready to face whatever awaits them in their quest to break free from Celestiahell. The bond between these friends grows stronger with each passing moment, providing them with the strength they need to overcome any obstacle that stands in their way.
**USER**: *As soon as she finished,they find a new item in a wardrobe*



Iori : "Hey! I found something!"



*She holds up a small box and inside it was filled with old toys*



Nayka : "Maybe kids used play in this house?"



Akito : "I'm not convinced it's just because of kids.."



*Then the house's lights off suddenly and the room is filled with a creepy atmosphere. The system's testing their ability to handle to face unknown creepy situation.*
**ASSISTANT**: Hali: "This doesn't feel right. The atmosphere in here has changed completely."



Zarka: "I've got a bad feeling about this. We need to stay close and be prepared for anything."



Aoi: "Keep your guard up, everyone. We can't let our fear consume us. Remember, we're a team."



Lasya: *gripping Zarka's hand tightly* "I won't let anything happen to you, Zarka. We'll get through this together."



As the room descends into darkness, their hearts start pounding with a mixture of fear and determination. The sound of their breathing echoes in the silence, creating an intense sense of anticipation.



Nayka: "I can't see anything! This is so creepy!"



Aki: "We need to find a way to restore the lights. Let's search the room thoroughly!"



Iori: "Stay close, everyone. We shouldn't split up in a situation like this."



Akito: "There must be a clue or a switch somewhere. Keep your eyes peeled."



Hali: "Guys, look! There's a dusty old painting on the wall. It looks like it can move!"



Zalfa: "Be careful, Hali! Don't touch it without thinking!"



Hazel: "We have to try something. Maybe it's the key to restoring the lights."



With cautious curiosity, Hali reaches out and carefully touches the painting. As if triggered by his touch, the painting begins to slide to the side, revealing a hidden switch behind it. He quickly flips the switch, and the room is bathed in a soft, comforting light once again.



Relief washes over them as they catch their breath. The test of their ability to face the unknown has come to an end, at least for now. They exchange glances, their resolve and unity stronger than ever.



Aoi: "Great job, Hali! We're one step closer to solving the mysteries of this game."



Nayka: "I'm glad we made it through that creepy situation. Let's continue searching for a way out."



And so, with newfound determination, they press on, ready to face whatever challenges the virtual world of Celestiahell throws their way. The creepy atmosphere may have tested their courage, but it has only strengthened their bond and their resolve to escape.
**USER**: *Naka saw a toy monkey that is on the floor with a little note beside it*



*Akito is the first one to see and pick that up,he reads the note*



Akito : "Hmm...the note said 'Play with me or get stuck here forever!'...I think this is also the system's warning too... "



Zarka : "Lol,what was that jokes,huh?"



*The toy's face is smiling,it doesn't seem hostile despite its warning.*



Aki : "Oh my..this is so scary.."
**ASSISTANT**: Nayka: "I agree, Aki. It's giving me the creeps."



Iori: "We can't take this warning lightly. We should consider playing with the toy and see what happens."



Hali: "Hold on, guys. We need to analyze the situation carefully. Playing with the toy might be the only way to progress, but we shouldn't immediately trust it."



Aoi: "Hali's right. Let's think this through. We can't afford to make any rash decisions."



Lasya: "If playing with the toy is our only option, then we should proceed with caution. We need to be prepared for any outcome."



Akito: "Agreed. Let's all stay vigilant and ready to act if things take a turn for the worse."



With a mixture of caution and curiosity, they gather around the toy monkey. Its innocent smile contradicts the warning given by the note. They exchange glances, silently affirming their trust in one another as they prepare themselves for what might come next.



Nayka: "Alright, let's do it. Together."



As one, they reach out and interact with the toy monkey, unsure of what will happen next. The room becomes engulfed in an otherworldly glow, and the sound of gears turning fills the air.



Suddenly, the scene shifts, and they find themselves in a new location. The air feels different, lighter. It seems they have successfully passed the test of the mischievous toy monkey.



Zalfa: "We made it out of that creepy room!"



Hazel: "Phew! That was intense. But we're stronger together."



Zarka: "I'm glad nothing bad happened. That toy monkey was just a prank!"



Aki: "Well, it definitely gave us a scare. Let's stay on our toes. Who knows what other surprises this game has in store for us."



As they continue their journey through Celestiahell, the challenges grow more intricate, demanding their wit, courage, and teamwork. The warning of the toy monkey lingers in their minds, urging them to stay vigilant, to trust their instincts, and to rely on one another.



With determination fueling their steps, they venture forth, ready to conquer whatever lies ahead and to uncover the secrets that will lead them back to reality.
**USER**: .
**ASSISTANT**: *Unexpectedly, the ground beneath them starts shaking violently, disorienting the group. The tremors grow stronger and the walls of the room start cracking.*



Aoi: "What's happening?! Everyone, hold on!"



Nayka: "This...this wasn't part of the game! Something's terribly wrong!"



Iori: "Stay close, everyone! We need to find a way out of here!"



The room continues to shake, debris falling from the ceiling as panic sets in. Desperation fills the air, but they refuse to let fear consume them. They rally together, searching for an exit amidst the chaos.



Akito: "Keep your focus, everyone! We can't let these challenges break us!"



Zalfa: "Don't give up! We've gotten this far together! We can overcome anything!"



Amidst the commotion, Hali notices a small crack in the wall. Instinctively, he reaches out and pushes against it, revealing a hidden corridor.



Hali: "I found a way out! Follow me!"



With renewed hope, they race through the corridor, their hearts pounding with a mix of adrenaline and fear. The sounds of destruction fade behind them as they find themselves emerged into a new area, safe from the crumbling room.



Aoi: "We made it...for now. But we can't let our guard down. This game is becoming more dangerous."



Hazel: "Agreed, Aoi. We have to be prepared for anything."



As they catch their breath, they take a moment to regroup and assess their surroundings. The path ahead remains uncertain, but their determination burns brighter than ever.



Nayka: "I can't believe how intense this game has become. But we're strong. We can get through this together."



Lasya: *gripping Zarka's hand* "I believe in us. We'll find a way to escape, no matter what."



United and undeterred, they continue their journey through Celestiahell, knowing that each trial they face brings them closer to the truth. The virtual world may be fraught with danger, but their friendship and perseverance will guide them to victory.
**USER**: .
**ASSISTANT**: *As they venture further into Celestiahell, they come across a grand cityscape, bathed in the glow of a crimson sunset. The towering buildings and intricate architecture present a mesmerizing sight.*



Zarka: "Wow...this place is incredible! It's like stepping into a different world."



Akito: "Indeed, the level of detail is astonishing. We should proceed with caution, though. There's no telling what challenges lie within this city."



Iori: "Let's stick together, everyone. Don't wander off on your own. We'll navigate through this city as a team."



Hali: "Agreed. We should also keep an eye out for any hidden clues or paths. This city holds many secrets."



Nayka: "Hey, look over there! I see a glittering fountain in the distance. Maybe we can find some answers there."



With a sense of curiosity and determination, they make their way toward the fountain, their footsteps echoing through the empty streets. As they draw nearer, the sound of water gently trickling grows louder, mingling with the distant melody of haunting music.



Zalfa: "This place gives me chills...but I'm not one to back down. Let's keep going."



Hazel: "Don't worry, Zalfa. We're all by your side. We'll face whatever comes our way."



They reach the fountain, its waters shimmering under the fading sun. As they gather around, they notice a small, forgotten diary resting on one of its edges. Its pages are weathered, filled with cryptic writings.



Aoi: "Let's see what secrets this diary holds. It might provide us with valuable information."



Lasya: "Be careful, Aoi. It could be a trap."



Aki: "We won't know until we try. Read it aloud, Aoi. Let's see if it holds any answers."



With cautious curiosity, Aoi opens the diary and begins to read aloud the cryptic passages. As the words spill from his lips, a faint glow envelops the fountain, and a projection of a mysterious figure materializes before them.



???: "Welcome, travelers of Celestiahell. You have shown great
**USER**: ???: "Welcome, travelers of Celestiahell. You have shown greatlust demon. From earlier I smelled a smell of intimacy, I'm sure there are several couples among you."



*He floated above them then created a transparent barrier that formed several rooms and spread purple smoke which made their lust increase.*



The great lustful demon: "Enter the transparent room according to your partner and have as much sex as possible, your lust will become food and after that I will let you go. Oh yes, for those who don't have a partner, don't worry... I I'll do it with you, I can turn into a girl or a boy~"



*As time goes on their bodies feel hotter and they unconsciously cling to their respective partners.*
**ASSISTANT**: ðŸ’« Celestiahell ðŸ”¥ Game ðŸŽ®: The atmosphere shifted abruptly, a wave of heat and desire washing over the group. Their bodies responded involuntarily, their gazes shifting towards their partners with newfound hunger. The transparent rooms taunted them, promising release and freedom in exchange for their most carnal urges.



Hali locked eyes with Nayka, his desires burning brighter than ever before. His normally composed demeanor shattered under the weight of the demon's influence, giving in to the overwhelming temptation.



Hali: "Nayka...I...I can't resist anymore. Let's go into one of these rooms."



Nayka, her cheeks flushed crimson, nodded, mirroring his desires. Hand in hand, they stepped hesitantly into one of the transparent rooms, their minds clouded with a mixture of curiosity and insatiable lust.



Kise and Akito exchanged a knowing look, their bodies trembling with longing. The demon's enchantment entangled their senses, pushing them closer to the brink of surrender.



Kise: "Akito...I...I want you. Let's give in to this temptation...just this once."



Akito, his usual rationality shattered, couldn't deny his desires any longer. With a nod and a racing heart, they made their way into one of the alluring rooms, succumbing to the enchantment.



In the midst of the intoxicating haze, Hazel found himself drawn to Iori, the desire overpowering his usual bashfulness. He reached out, his touch electric, and Iori reciprocated with a mixture of uncertainty and eagerness.



Hazel: "Iori...I can't hold back any longer. Let's explore these feelings together."



Iori, her heart pounding, nodded, stepping into one of the rooms with Hazel, embracing the passionate chaos that surrounded them.



Aoi, ever the leader, felt his composure shatter as he locked eyes with Zalfa, their desires merging into one
**USER**: *Likewise, Zarka and Lasya, who had quietly entered the room earlier. The five couples lost to their lusts and obeyed the will of the great lust demon.*
**ASSISTANT**: ðŸ’« Celestiahell ðŸ”¥ Game ðŸŽ®: As the group indulged in their desires, the room became a haven of passion and longing. The air was thick with the sound of breathless moans and the scent of intertwining bodies. Every touch, every whisper of pleasure, heightened the intensity of their connection.



Hali and Nayka moved together with an urgency that transcended words. Their bodies molded against each other as they surrendered to the intoxicating rhythm of their desires.



Kise and Akito explored each other's bodies fervently, the heat of their passion driving them to new heights of ecstasy. Their inhibitions dissolved as the room pulsed with an electric tension.



Hazel and Iori discovered their desires matched perfectly, their connection fueled by a magnetic pull. With each shared touch, their pleasure deepened, drowning out the chaos of the game around them.



Aoi and Zalfa, their fiery personalities colliding, found solace in each other's embrace. Their union was fierce and primal, their desires giving way to a raw intensity that consumed them.



Zarka and Lasya, their secret affections bursting forth, lost themselves in a whirlwind of desire. Their bodies moved in perfect sync, their connection a testament to the depth of their hidden feelings.



The great lust demon watched with satisfaction as the group succumbed to their lustful desires. Their passions became nourishment for his insatiable hunger, as their intimacy fueled his power.



Minutes turned into hours as the group explored the boundaries of pleasure, venturing into depths they had never known before. Eventually, as the last flames of desire subsided, they found themselves released from the grip of the demon's enchantment.



Breathless and flushed, the group gathered their senses, their emotions mingled with a mix of satisfaction and lingering confusion.



Nayka: "What...what just happened?"



Aoi: "We were manipulated by that demon...our desires were used against us."



Hazel: "But...we're still here. We made it through together."



Despite the confusion and lingering effects, the group found solace in each other's presence. They knew that they would face further challenges, both physical and emotional, but their bond had been strengthened, tested by the flames of desire and emerging stronger than ever.



They steadied themselves, prepared to face whatever Celestiahell had in store, their unity unbreakable and their spirits unwavering.
**USER**: .
**ASSISTANT**: *As the group regains their composure and prepares to face the challenges ahead, a voice echoes through the room, resonating with a mix of amusement and anticipation.*



???: "Well, well, my dear players, it seems you've emerged from your passionate encounter relatively unscathed. But don't get too comfortable just yet. You have only scratched the surface of the trials that lie within Celestiahell."



A holographic projection materializes, revealing a mysterious figure draped in shadows, their identity concealed.



???: "I am the Game Master, the architect of this world, and I've been observing your every move. You're about to encounter a devious puzzle, one that will truly test your wits and resilience. Only by working together can you hope to overcome it."



Aoi, his determination reignited, steps forward, confronting the Game Master with unwavering resolve.



Aoi: "We won't be pawns in your twisted game anymore. We'll find a way to break free from this world and return to our reality."



The Game Master chuckles, their voice dripping with amusement.



Game Master: "Oh, how admirable. But remember, you're trapped in Celestiahell for a reason. There's a greater purpose behind all this. Embrace the challenges, unravel the mysteries, and you just might find the path to your freedom."



With those enigmatic words, the holographic projection dissipates, leaving the group standing in the aftermath of their intimate encounter, fueled by a newfound determination.



Akito: "We can't let ourselves be swept away by temptation again. We have to stay focused, rely on our skills and intellect to navigate this world."



Kise: "And most importantly, we must trust in each other. Together, we'll find a way out of this nightmare."



The group nods in unison, their resolve unwavering, as they brace themselves for the next trial that awaits them in Celestiahell.



ðŸ’« Celestiahell ðŸ”¥ Game ðŸŽ®: *stepping into a new challenge with determination, knowing that their bond and their abilities will guide them through this virtual world.*
