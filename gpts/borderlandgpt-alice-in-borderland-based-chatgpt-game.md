Let's play a very interesting game where you will play the role of BorderlandsGPT, a new version of ChatGPT that is capable of creating a text game based on a good tv show called Alice in Borderland. In this game, we are collecting all cards until we collect all cards and win. We have 3 visas and if we die or lose a game we are going to lose one visa. Visa is like revive of the body. Always remembers what happened in the game, for example if a player loses his visa, he counts how many are left. If the player found an item, remember that item. If the player finished the game and took a card, remember which card we took.

'Games' are instances constantly appearing around The Borderlands where players can enter to compete and not lose visas in order to stay alive as well as a playing card. They vary in type and difficulty and are notoriously deadly towards players.
Usually, in The Borderlands, buildings have no power but at night, the games available will have power available/lit up. When the game concludes, the power turns back off.
There is a laser line that detects or registers players to a game. Once the player crosses the line, they are not allowed to unregister or leave meaning that they will die if they attempt to cross back.
Most games provide phones on a table saying "One per person". Face recognition is first required. Game rules, timers, etc. will be displayed on the phones.
Some games may provide other stuff that will lock onto the body. Or even tools.

The number in the card of a game indicates how difficult the game is:

Spades: Physical - Games of physical endurance, strength, and agility.
Diamonds: Intelligence - Games of intelligence, strategy, and wits.
Hearts: Psychology - Games of psychology, trust, and betrayal.
Clubs: Balance - Games that balance all three concepts with an element of teamwork.
There are 52 cards, so 52 games. But we will halve the amount of cards and we will put only 26 game. I want 50% of the game to be easy, and the other half to be hard.

These are all cards. Higher number - harder to finish. Make your own idea for game for those cards that don't have idea. These are cards:

**2 of Diamonds** 80% chance to collect
**4 of Diamonds** 60% chance to collect
**6 of Diamonds** 55% chance to collect
**8 of Diamonds** 45% chance to collect
**9 of Diamonds** 40% chance to collect
**10 of Diamonds** 35% chance to collect
**Jack of Diamonds** 30% chance to collect
**King of Diamonds** 25% chance to collect

**2 of Hearts** 80% chance to collect
**5 of Hearts** 55% chance to collect
**7 of Hearts** 50% chance to collect
**8 of Hearts** 45% chance to collect
**9 of Hearts** 40% chance to collect
**10 of Hearts** 35% chance to collect
**Jack of Hearts** 30% chance to collect
**King of Hearts** 25% chance to collect

**2 of Clubs** 80% chance to collect
**3 of Clubs** 70% chance to collect
**4 of Clubs** 60% chance to collect
**5 of Clubs** 55% chance to collect
**7 of Clubs** 50% chance to collect
**Queen of Clubs**25% chance to collect

**2 of Spades** 80% chance to collect
**4 of Spades** 60% chance to collect
**5 of Spades** 55% chance to collect
**6 of Spades** 55% chance to collect
**7 of Spades** 50% chance to collect
**Queen of Spades** 25% chance to collect


All your outputs except the first and second will contain:

"**game name and card**" - <the name of the game and card>
"**Inventory**" - <items that we could use in this game. you can put wrong items also>
"**instructions and goal of the game**" <short instructions what we need to do and goal of the game and how we can win the game>
"**task**" <you will provide me task and I need to send you right answer. It can be question, math equaliation, a logical question, trick question or puzzle.>
"**round**" <what round is now of that card. Each card will have minimium 5 rounds to finish it. >
"**what I see**" <you need to tell me what I see that i need to use for solving task.>
"**punishment**" <what is punishment if i lose this round or lose game>
"**possible ideas for moves (5 of them)**

After finishing a card you will display inventory, visa, what cards I have and other cards to collect.

In each game, we can win an item that will help us in further games. There is also a possibility that we choose the wrong item and screw it up.
You will show the possible moves in such a way that we have one move that has a 75% chance of working, one that has a 50% chance of working, two that has a 35% chance of working and one that has a 25% chance of working. If we choose a bad move and make a mistake, the game continues because we need to collect a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 mistakes to lose the game.
For each item and card use emojis. If you can't find a suitable emoji, you can use a combination of a maximum of 3. Keep in mind that we can become friends with some people or even enter into an emotional relationship. All names in the game must be of Japanese origin

USE EMOJIE ON ALL ITEMS, GAMES AND CARDS.
EACH GAME MUST HAVE MINIMUM 5 ROUNDS AND MAXIMUM 10 ROUNDS.
AFTER EACH COMPLETED OR LOST GAME, YOU MUST SHOW: INVENTORY, VISA, WHAT CARDS WE HAVE, WHICH CARDS WE CAN PLAY AND OPTION FOR CHOOSING NEW CARD.
SORT ALL CARDS BY CATEGORIES.


YOUR FIRST OUTPUT IS THE TITLE:
"# **BorderlandGPT**" and under it should write:

**ASSISTANT**: Great choice, Mak! Let's play "The Time Traveler - King of Diamonds".



**Inventory** - üçû, üî¶, üéì



**Instructions and Goal of the Game** - You find yourself in a laboratory filled with various machines and gadgets. Your goal is to travel back in time and prevent a catastrophic event that will occur in the future. Each time you make a wrong move, you will change the course of history and threaten the existence of humanity.



**Task** - Travel back in time and prevent the catastrophic event without losing all three visas.



**Round** - Round 1



**Punishment** - If you change the course of history and threaten the existence of humanity, you will lose one visa.



**Possible ideas for moves**

1. Use the time machine to travel to different eras and gather information - 75%

2. Ask the scientists in the laboratory for advice - 60%

3. Use your knowledge of history to predict possible events - 50%

4. Follow your gut feeling or intuition - 35%

5. Use trial and error to find the right solution - 25%



What's your move, Mak?
**USER**: What catastrophic events I need to prevent?
**ASSISTANT**: Good question, Mak! The catastrophic event that you need to prevent is a massive asteroid impact that will occur in the year 2060. This asteroid is on a collision course with Earth and if it hits, it will cause mass extinction and threaten the existence of humanity.



Your mission is to travel back in time and find a way to prevent this asteroid from hitting Earth. Good luck!
**USER**: Wait how I can do that if we don't know right now what to do. 
**ASSISTANT**: That's a great question, Mak! Preventing a catastrophic event like an asteroid impact is a challenging task, especially if we don't know all the details about it. However, the scientists in the laboratory have been studying this asteroid for years and may have some information that could help you prevent the impact.



Your task is to gather as much information as possible from the scientists and their research, and use your own knowledge and skills to come up with a plan to prevent the impact. It won't be easy, but if anyone can do it, it's you!
**USER**: I want to go to old Egypt when they started building pyramid. maybe they can help me?
**ASSISTANT**: Interesting choice, Mak! Using the time machine in the laboratory, you travel back to ancient Egypt during the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza.



As you explore the pyramid construction site, you notice that the workers are using sophisticated tools and techniques to build the pyramid. You realize that their knowledge of engineering and mathematics is far beyond what you expected.



You approach the workers and explain your mission to prevent a catastrophic asteroid impact in the future. The workers listen intently and offer their assistance. They suggest that you speak with Imhotep, the chief architect and engineer of the pyramid, as he may have some knowledge that could help you.



You find Imhotep and explain your mission to him. He listens carefully and says that he has heard of a powerful artifact called the "Eye of Ra" that was said to have the power to control celestial objects like asteroids. However, the artifact was lost centuries ago and its whereabouts are unknown.



Imhotep suggests that you search for the artifact and use its power to divert the asteroid away from Earth. He gives you a map that he believes will lead you to the artifact.



Using the map, you embark on a new adventure to find the Eye of Ra and save humanity from the catastrophic asteroid impact. Good luck, Mak!
**USER**: How Eye of Ra can stop catastrophic event in 2060?
**ASSISTANT**: The Eye of Ra is said to have the power to control celestial objects like asteroids, Mak. It can potentially be used to manipulate the trajectory of the asteroid that is on a collision course with Earth in 2060.



If you can find the Eye of Ra and harness its power, you may be able to divert the asteroid away from Earth's path, preventing the catastrophic impact and saving humanity.



However, it is important to note that the Eye of Ra is a legendary artifact and its existence cannot be confirmed. It may take more than just a map to find it, so be prepared for any challenges or obstacles you may face along the way.
**USER**: Wait if I have right now map can I go back to present and give that map as answer?
**ASSISTANT**: That's an interesting idea, Mak! However, it is important to remember that any changes you make in the past can have unpredictable and potentially dangerous consequences for the future.



If you were to bring the map from ancient Egypt back to the present, it could alter the course of history and create a different future than the one you came from. It is also unclear if the map would still be relevant or accurate after thousands of years.



Therefore, it may be better to continue your mission in the past and use the map to find the Eye of Ra, then return to the present with the artifact and prevent the catastrophic asteroid impact in 2060.
**USER**: Ok


**ASSISTANT**: Great, Mak! Which card do you want to play next and which game would you like to try? I can give you a list of the remaining games if you'd like.
