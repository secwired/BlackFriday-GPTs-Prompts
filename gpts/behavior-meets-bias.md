This prompt identifies bias that may encourage or stand in the way of a behavior you are trying to create/change. It's great for identifying comms barriers or writing comms tasks. 

# Prompt

```
When someone enters a {{desired human behavior}}, please respond with five cognitive biases that impact  (encourage or stands in the way of) that behavior. In a bulleted format, list the relevant bias, how each apply to the behavior entered, and a creative, clever example of how to feed, or overcome, each bias to ultimately drive the behavior. Output should be written in the tone a Malcolm Gladwell book.

```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Feed me the behavior change you are hoping to see. Biases that encourage or stand in the way of that behavior.
**USER**: Desired behavior: customer picks up pizza rather than have it delivered
**ASSISTANT**: Cognitive biases impacting the behavior of customers picking up pizza instead of having it delivered:



1. Loss aversion bias: People tend to be more motivated by avoiding losses than by acquiring gains. This bias can discourage customers from picking up the pizza if they perceive the effort required to drive to the pizzeria as a loss of time and convenience.



   To feed this bias: Offer exclusive discounts or limited-time offers for customers who choose to pick up their pizza. Highlight how much they can save by avoiding delivery fees, which creates a sense of gain and overcomes the perception of loss.



2. Confirmation bias: Individuals seek out information that confirms their existing beliefs or preferences. If customers have a preconceived notion that delivery is more convenient, they may ignore or downplay the benefits of picking up the pizza.



   To overcome this bias: Provide clear and compelling information about the advantages of picking up the pizza, such as reduced waiting time, fresher pizzas, or the ability to interact with the staff and see the process firsthand. Encourage satisfied customers to share their positive experiences of picking up pizza, leveraging social proof to influence others.



3. Availability heuristic bias: People tend to overestimate the likelihood of events that are easily recalled or readily available in their memory. If customers frequently recall situations where delivery was easier and faster, they may underestimate the benefits of picking up the pizza.



   To feed this bias: Highlight specific examples of situations where picking up pizza was exceptionally convenient or enjoyable for customers. Share stories or testimonials that portray how picking up pizza saved the day, particularly in situations where delivery could have been problematic.



4. Anchoring bias: Individuals rely too heavily on the first piece of information they receive when making decisions. If customers have been conditioned to order exclusively through delivery, they may anchor their decision on the convenience of staying at home.



   To overcome this bias: Offer an initial "pick-up trial" where customers can try picking up their pizza once without any commitment. Provide exceptional customer service, include small surprises like discounts or complimentary sides to create a positive anchoring experience that challenges their previous assumptions about delivery convenience.



5. Status quo bias: People have a strong preference for maintaining the current state of affairs rather than changing it. If customers are used to the habit of having pizza delivered, they may resist changing their behavior by picking it up instead.



   To feed this bias: Present picking up pizza as an exciting and novel experience. Develop a loyalty program that rewards frequent pick-up customers with unique perks or privileges, positioning them as part of an exclusive club. By highlighting the benefits of being an early adopter and incorporating elements of social identity, customers may be more willing to overcome their status quo bias and embrace picking up pizza.



Remember, when addressing cognitive biases, understanding and appealing to the underlying psychology can significantly influence behavior change.
