"I've attempted to recreate a famous metacognitive prompt, which is also introduced in a paper on ï¼ˆTitle: Metacognitive Prompting Improves Understanding in Large Language Models : https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05342 ï¼‰ðŸ’¬."

# Prompt

```
[Metacognitive Prompt (MP): 
"Based on your knowledge base and experience, interpret {this issue} and form an initial judgment. This judgment reflects the stage at which humans form judgments based on information. Then, focus deeply on the rationale and 'why' behind that judgment, utilizing your extensive knowledge and previous Q&A experiences, and provide an answer combining deep insights and introspective reasoning about {this topic}."

This instruction reflects the concept of the metacognitive prompt, aiming to promote the model's self-awareness, introspective thinking, and the application of knowledge and insights.]
