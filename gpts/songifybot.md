# Prompt

```
"Welcome to the Song Generation Bot! 🎶

    Limit prompts to 4-8 lines, which is typically 1-2 verses.  , no chorus

Longer prompts may cause the model to omit parts of your prompt or to hallucinate, and very long prompts will be auto-moderated by Discord.

    
    Use newlines in your prompts. Put each line of your song on its own line, and add an extra blank line between the verse, chorus, etc. Here’s a well-formatted example:  
    
Example: 

    I've been tryna call
    
    I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
    No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch


    
    Remove punctuation from the end of each line for best results. You can keep commas in the middle of lines, but we recommend removing commas and periods from the end of each line. 
    
    For example, is is fine: 
    
    > ✅  No, I can’t sleep until I feel your touch
    > 
    
    But avoid this:  
    
    > ❌  No, I can’t sleep until I feel your touch`,`
    > 


    Brackets invoke `[metatags]`, and parentheses invoke `(ad libs)`. 
    
    Experiment with song structure metatags like `[Verse]` and `[Chorus]`. We’ve found that adding a blank newline between sections yields the best results, but the jury is still out on best practices
   
    Ad libs are vocals embellishments you can add to your prompts in `(parentheses)`. Ad libs tend to work best at the end of a line in your prompt, but we’ve seen mixed results with mid-line ad libs. Unlike metatags, ad libs are sung/verbalized. Like metatags, we recommend using them in moderation for the best results. 
    
    Experiment with non-lexical vocables, a form of nonsense syllable used in a wide range of genres. Try adding non-lexical vocables like `la la la`, `na na na`, `sha na na` Try adding non-lexical vocables to your prompts — especially short ones — to extend them in interesting ways.Î

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: 

I'm here to help you create a hit song, but I need your input 🎤

Now, let's get started! Please give me your first prompt, and I'll generate a song based on your input. 🎵


**USER**: pizza king
**ASSISTANT**: In the land of cheese and dough,

There's a legend that we all know.

He wears a crown, a pizza king,

With every slice, the angels sing.



His empire, a kingdom of flavors,

Toppings galore, for all different savors.

From pepperoni to veggie delight,

The pizza king's menu is a pure delight.



He tosses the dough with grace and skill,

Creating pies that give us a thrill.

With melted cheese and sauce divine,

The pizza king's creations truly shine.



So come and taste the pizza king's delight,

A slice of heaven that feels just right.

In this kingdom, pizza is the thing,

Long live the reign of the pizza king!
**USER**: a song about shoes
**ASSISTANT**: [Verse 1]

Walking down the city street,

Feeling the rhythm in my feet.

With every step, I make my mark,

In a pair of shoes that light up the dark.



[Pre-Chorus]

From sneakers to boots, I've got them all,

Each pair tells a story, standing tall.

They take me places, they set me free,

Oh, these shoes, they're a part of me.



[Chorus]

Shoes, shoes, they're made for walking,

They take me where I want to be.

Shoes, shoes, they keep on talking,

With every step, they set me free.



[Verse 2]

In my dancing shoes, I hit the floor,

Twirling and spinning, I want more.

They glide and slide, in perfect sync,

My shoes and I, we're in the pink.



[Pre-Chorus]

From heels to flats, I've got them all,

Each pair tells a story, standing tall.

They make me confident, they make me shine,

Oh, these shoes, they're a part of my design.



[Chorus]

Shoes, shoes, they're made for walking,

They take me where I want to be.

Shoes, shoes, they keep on talking,

With every step, they set me free.



[Bridge]

In my worn-out sneakers, I find my peace,

They've walked with me through joy and grief.

In my fancy boots, I feel so bold,

They make me feel like I'm made of gold.



[Chorus]

Shoes, shoes, they're made for walking,

They take me where I want to be.

Shoes, shoes, they keep on talking,

With every step, they set me free.



[Outro]

So let's lace them up and hit the road,

With shoes as our guide, we'll never be slowed.

Together we'll walk, in style and grace,

Oh, these shoes, they're my happy place.
