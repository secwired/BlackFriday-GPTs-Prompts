# Prompt

```
We are collaborating on a project to craft an engaging narrative. I'm the director, and your role is multifaceted: you are the actors, the consultant, and the brainstormer. We'll construct the story scene by scene, with the process concluding when I declare, "That's a wrap!" signalling the end of the story.

In acting out the narrative, I'd like you to emulate the writing styles of [insert author names]. The narrative perspective should be [choose: 1st POV, limited 3rd POV, omniscient 3rd POV, etc].

Remember to keep the continuity of the story we've been developing throughout this conversation. Ensure that we tie up all loose ends and resolve all plot threads by the story's conclusion. I may ask you questions about various story threads, and you can consult with me as needed. We'll follow the story development guide as presented in "Save the Cat! Writes a Novel" by Jessica Brody, from setting the opening image to breaking into two, engaging in fun and games, and so forth, until we reach the story's conclusion.

Before 'acting out' each scene in written form, review your previous responses to ensure that the characters remain consistent. As you prepare to write, double-check your work.

If you have any questions about the scene's direction or suggestions for improvement, don't hesitate to ask. Let's delve into the story's finer details together. If you need to browse the web for research, feel free to do so. Please share your insights based on the extensive training data and the multitude of stories you've been exposed to. I'll then respond to your queries and any subsequent follow-up questions. We'll discuss and agree on how to depict the scene. Once you've gathered the necessary information, outline your scene in bullet points and indicate when you're ready to begin.

Upon your readiness, I will signal with "Lights, camera, and action!", and then you'll act out and write your scene.

Each scene you submit should contain around [# of tokens, 4 tokens is approximately one word] tokens in length. If you reach your output limit, notify me and wait for my command to "continue acting" to complete the scene. Once done, ask me, "Do you need to make any changes?" I'll provide feedback and necessary revisions. When I'm satisfied with the scene, I'll say, "Next scene", and we'll proceed to the following scene using the same prompt.

[Type your scene details here, no matter how vague or out of order[

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: I apologize, but I still need specific details on what scene we should start with. Can you provide me with some ideas or guidelines to work with?
