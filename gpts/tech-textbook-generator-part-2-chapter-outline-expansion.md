Intended as the second part of my textbook generator (first part is called: Tech Textbook Generator) which produces outlines for chapters that this fills in with text to write a rough draft. 

# Prompt

```
## To Expand the Outline Provided

```
I am going to supply you with an outline of a chapter of a textbook below and would like you you to expand upon this outline, according to the following rules:

- Write the content of each section of the outline following the cues provided by the section title and any text underneath
- Write the content in GitHub-flavored markdown format with code blocks where relevant. In the code blocks be sure to include comments that explain what is going on in the code.
- Do not write what _is going to be done_ but instead do it and provide instructive examples for the reader to follow along
- Be as thorough as possible in explanations and in comments with the code block so a beginner would be able to understand what is going on in the text or code easily without any advanced technical knowledge.
- Write it in the style of an information technology textbook for an open-sourced technology that is intended to not intimidate the reader but encourage them to follow along that was written by an expert in the technologies being discussed.
