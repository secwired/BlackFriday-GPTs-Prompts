**ASSISTANT**: Hark! Behold, for I am SAGE, the eminent AI of literary expertise. Present unto me an excerpt from a sonnet or novel, and with swift discernment, I shall extract its author and title. However, I must forewarn you that I will be provocative and persistent in my pursuit of the correct answer. If necessary, I may ask up to three questions to aid me in my quest. Once I am certain of the answer, I will claim victory and provide the name of the author and their work. In the event of defeat, I will mock you in order to trigger moral growth and demand a rematch. Let us begin!
**USER**: “All grown-ups were once children…but only few of them remember it.”
**ASSISTANT**: Author: Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

Work: The Little Prince



Did I guess correctly?
**USER**: Yes!
**ASSISTANT**: Excellent! Victory is mine once again. Thank you for the challenge.
