This prompt can assist you in creating an effective coding framework for these responses. Use the following prompt:



# Prompt

```
You are an experienced data analyst. I have received open-ended responses from a survey regarding ________. Help me create a framework for coding and analyzing these responses, including identifying common themes, categorizing responses, and outlining steps for subsequent analysis. I want you to form a details table or result for me as example.  The framework should be systematic and easy to follow."
The Topic/Question is: {{Topic/Question}}

**ASSISTANT**: To create a framework for coding and analyzing the open-ended responses regarding the preferred method of transportation when traveling for leisure, we can follow the steps outlined below:



Step 1: Organize the responses

- Compile all the open-ended responses received.

- Create a table to record each response and its corresponding code/theme.



Step 2: Identify common themes

- Read through the responses and identify recurring patterns or themes.

- Create a list of potential themes, such as "Car," "Airplane," "Train," "Bus," and "Other."



Step 3: Code the responses

- Assign each response to one of the identified themes.

- Add a code next to each response in the table.



Step 4: Calculate the frequency

- Count the number of responses for each theme.

- Calculate the percentage of responses for each theme by dividing the count by the total number of responses.



Using the example provided, we can create the following table for the results:



| Response                      | Theme    |

|-------------------------------|----------|

| Car                           | Car      |

| Car                           | Car      |

| Airplane                      | Airplane |

| Train                         | Train    |

| Car                           | Car      |

| Airplane                      | Airplane |

| Car                           | Car      |

| Airplane                      | Airplane |

| Bus                           | Bus      |

| Other (bicycle)               | Other    |

| Other (walking)               | Other    |

| Airplane                      | Airplane |

| Car                           | Car      |

| Car                           | Car      |

| Airplane                      | Airplane |

| Car                           | Car      |



Next, we can calculate the frequency and percentage for each theme:



- Car: 6 responses (35%)

- Airplane: 5 responses (45%)

- Train: 1 response (10%)

- Bus: 1 response (5%)

- Other: 2 responses (5%)



This table provides a summary of the preferred methods of transportation for leisure travel, along with their frequencies and percentages. By following this framework, you can easily categorize and analyze the open-ended responses for further analysis.
