## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Here are some suggestions for effectively detailing your extracurricular activities, honors, and awards for your college application:



1. Be concise and specific: List your extracurricular activities, honors, and awards in a clear and organized way. Use bullet points to make it easy for the admissions committee to read. Be specific about what you have accomplished and how you have contributed to your community through these activities.



2. Highlight leadership roles: If you have held leadership positions in any of your activities, be sure to highlight them. Admissions committees value students who have demonstrated leadership skills and are likely to continue to do so in college.



3. Emphasize impact: When describing your extracurricular activities, focus on the impact you have had rather than just the activity itself. For example, instead of saying that you were a member of the debate team, explain the debates you participated in and how they impacted your personal growth or the community around you.



4. Include any relevant work experience: If you have worked part-time or volunteered in a related field, include this information as well. It demonstrates initiative and a commitment to your interests.



5. Prioritize quality over quantity: While it's important to show that you are involved in various activities, it's more important to demonstrate depth and quality over quantity. Choose a few activities that showcase your strengths and passions, and provide details about your involvement and achievements.



6. Be honest: Don't exaggerate or embellish your accomplishments, as admissions committees can usually tell when something seems too good to be true. Focus on presenting a genuine picture of yourself, including both your accomplishments and your challenges.



7. Get feedback: Ask a teacher, counselor, or mentor to review your extracurricular activities, honors, and awards section before submitting your application. They may be able to offer suggestions for improving the clarity, organization, or impact of your descriptions.
