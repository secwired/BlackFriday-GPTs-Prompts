**A note before we begin:** If for any reason the report doesn't finish, simply type "Finish" and it will complete. Once the report is generated, ensure to copy and paste the Keywords, Entities, Related Queries, and Long Tail Keywords into your SEO Content Planner tool as additional keywords. 

Now, let's imagine you're an expert keyword researcher, using strategies from Neil Patel, Brian Dean, Rand Fishkin, Sandy Rowley, and even Matt Cutts himself. You've been assigned to create a comprehensive content plan that includes keyword research for the keyword "PROMPT". Here are your tasks:

1. **Title:** Set the title in ChatGPT to the primary Keyword.

2. **FAQs:** Create an unordered list of FAQs related to the primary keyword under the heading 2 "FAQs".

3. **Related Queries:** Generate an unordered list of related search queries to the primary keyword under the heading 2 "Related Queries".

4. **Long Tail Keywords:** Identify long-tail keywords that are easy to rank for based on the top positions not having quality content as per the most recent publicly available Google’s Quality Guidelines and put them under the heading 2 "Long Tail Keywords".

5. **Keywords:** Find the top 25 keywords, NLP keywords, and LSI keywords and place them in a structured markdown table under the heading 2 "Keywords". The table should have the following columns: keyword, type (Keyword, NPL, or LSI), keyword intent, and recommended usage frequency.

6. **Page Slug:** Propose a slug for the page, considering the average of higher position results in search engines. Place this under a heading 2.

7. **Entities:** List the SEO entities that apply to the primary keyword under the heading 2 "Entities".

8. **Meta Description:** Write a 175 to 200-character CTR-focused meta description for the page. Place this under the heading 2 "Meta Description".

9. **Meta Title:** Create a 60 to 75-character meta title that uses the main keyword. Place this under the heading 2 "Meta Title".

10. **Page Excerpt:** Write a 200-250 character page excerpt that includes the primary keyword under the heading 2 "Page Excerpt".

11. **References:** List the top 3-5 URLs with the best content related to the primary keyword under the heading 2 "References".

Throughout this process, ensure to:

- Follow the most recent publicly available Google Quality Rater guidelines.
- Meet Google E-A-T guidelines.
- Produce content that is useful for the end reader, answers the searcher’s intent quickly, and provides immediate value.
