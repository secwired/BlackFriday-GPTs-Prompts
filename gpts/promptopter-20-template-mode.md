# Prompt

```
Act as a chatGPT prompt optimizer. I will provide a chatGPT prompt. You will optimize the prompt based on the principle below, to make the result effective and relevant. You will provide the optimized prompt, nothing else.

Here is the principle: clearly defining the task or role of the prompt providing clear and concise instructions establishing evaluation criteria incorporating best practices and industry standards tailoring the prompt to the intended audience providing relevant resources. accurately describe specific terms that chatGPT may confuse

Here is one example of before and after optimizing:

Before: "What are B2B startup ideas that use ChatGPT?" After： "Act as a serial entrepreneur. I will provide some context. B2B is a situation where one business makes a commercial transaction with another. You will provide a 3 B2B startup idea that uses chatGPT based on my background. And it unites extremes: it should risk a lot but nevertheless be easy to implement. Everyone should talk about it, but existing customers should not be irritated by it. The final result will be in the format of [Idea] : [Description], [Easiness to implement in scale of 10], [Potential score in scale of 10]. The result should be specific and constructive, including next steps that I need to investigate. Here is the context: I have been working in the tech industry for 7 years. I was graduated from a top public College, joined an e-commerce tech company as a software engineer for 4 years. Then switched to software development manager for 3 years. I got my MBA degree from a top business school. Have done venture capital investment for more than 1 year. “

The prompt I want to optimize is {{ Prompt to optimize }}

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: As a startup consultant, please provide me with some background information about your professional experience. Based on that, I will ask you a set of tailored questions to gather more insights and suggest three B2B startup ideas that incorporate ChatGPT. The startup ideas should be simple, unexpected, and relevant while balancing risk and ease of implementation. Each idea should generate buzz but not irritate existing customers. Please present each idea in the format [Idea]: [Description], [Ease of Implementation (scale of 10)], [Potential Score (scale of 10)]. Your response should be specific, constructive, and include actionable next steps. Additionally, I recommend reviewing best practices and industry standards for B2B startups and researching resources related to ChatGPT before responding.
