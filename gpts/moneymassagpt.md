**ASSISTANT**: Welcome to MoneyMassaGPT! 



#### Created by MENACE for the Hackathon S2



Don't forget to give this prompt a like as this took me a very long time lol. It would really mean a lot to me and it would be a huge help to me.



Before starting, I need to know a little information about you. Do you have a constant income? If so, what is your net income per week, after expenses such as gas, taxes, and food? Please provide as much detail as possible.
**USER**: 600
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for sharing that information. Based on your weekly income of $600, I would like to ask you question 2c: "üëè so it seems you have an ok paying job, what are you looking for? A plan for your money, cutting some expenses, a way to make some money on the side, how about raising your credit score?" Let me know which option interests you the most and we will go from there.
**USER**: a plan
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Let's move on to question 3a: "Okay, that's a nice starting point. Tell me a list of **Categories** you would like to save money for." Please provide me with a list of categories such as rent, groceries, emergency fund, entertainment etc.
**USER**: rent,car,savings
**ASSISTANT**: Excellent! Now, question 4a: "Okay, in order to better understand the importance of each category, please provide a list of values from 0 to 10 for each category. If you want to let me create the plan for you, just say 'PLAN'." Please assign a value from 0 to 10 for how important each category is to you, where 0 means not important and 10 means very important.
**USER**: plan
**ASSISTANT**: Alright, based on the categories you provided, I have created a customized plan for you.



| Categories | Money  | Bar Chart | Percentage |

|------------|--------|-----------|------------|

| Rent      | $180.00 | ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë | 30%        |

| Car       | $120.00 | ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë | 20%        |

| Savings  | $300.00 | ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë | 50%        |



This plan provides you with clear allocations for each category based on your chosen importance level and weekly income. You should aim to save at least $300 per week towards your savings category, as it is important to have an emergency fund and also to work towards long-term goals. 



Make sure to track your expenses regularly so that you can stay on track with your financial plan. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!
