- [Mr. Beast] I've recreated every single set from Squid Game in real life, and whichever one of these 456 people survives the longest, wins 456 grand. (contestants cheering) The first game we're gonna play is red light, green light. They have 30 minutes to cross the red line on the other side of the huge room. So without further ado, green light. (tense music) Red light. (gun shot) Oh, oh. And as you can see, every single player has a device strapped to them, that when they're eliminated, it pops. Chris, you wanna have a chance at one? - Red light. (gun shot) Oh, oh, no. - I know for sure this guy moved. Green light. - Red light. Oh yo, they're dropping. Okay, now some people are getting out. - You gotta get a better spot for the next red light, right? - Mmhmm. - You're fine. - 30 people have gotten out so far. If they move right now, they're out. They have to hold this position until we say green light. And I can take all the time I want, 'cause we still have 23 minutes left. - We gotta get a green light going. This guy's doing a full squat. - Green light. Green light. Oh they all stopped. Red light. (gun shot) Oh. - I called it, I called it. Oh no. - Can you push my glasses up? - Okay. - Do it slowly though, be careful. - Are you good? - Yeah, perfect. - Okay. Green light. Red light. You're still moving. She was jogging over here. We're gonna go see who's in the very back. You are in dead last. What's going on? - I let the others clear the path for me. - You literally haven't even moved. - Well, a couple steps. - We'll see if it pans out, green light. Yellow, red light. Oh, that we got her, the yellow light worked. - Oh, that was diabolical to throw a yellow light out there. - Since 067 was a big part of the show. I'll let you say green light. - [All] Green light. - Red light, yo, it would be funny if she just got out. As you can see, over 100 people have been eliminated. Do the honors, Chandler. - Green light, red light. (gun shot) - [Mr. Beast] Oh, that was a loud one. - There it is, ay. - Green light. Red light. Look how close they are to the finish line. It is do or die for most of these people. Everyone look up at the TV. You have four minutes and 20 seconds left. - Yeah, that's the number. - Green light, red light. We have our first two finishers over here. - Lets go! - Green light, red light. - Yes sir, baby. Yes sir, baby. - [Mr. Beast] All right, we have five people across the finish line now. - [Chandler] You're all kind of screwed if you don't run faster. - Yep, you're right. - Green light. Red light. - Only two minutes remain. - Karl makes me way too nervous. - Green light. Red light. - We have under one minute remaining. Time's ticking, green light. Red light. You have stepped on the line, you are good. You're good. You're good. - Lets go! - Red light. (gun shot) It worked, it worked, we got em. You're definitely out. Dude, I knew that would work, green light. Red light. You're definitely, so many of you just got out. - They gotta run faster. - They've gotta, you gotta sprint. - Green light. Green light. I'm not even gonna say red light, I'm not saying red light. Ah, its too late. Too late. (crowd cheering) - Whoa. - Holy crap. - Congratulations on surviving red light green light. (contestants cheering) So if you look at this TV, you'll see that only (TV twinkling) 232 of you survived. If you look above your head, you'll see the $456,000 you're competing for. And now let's move on to honeycomb. In honeycomb, everyone gets a needle, and a cookie with a different shape on it, and they have 10 minutes to remove the shape from the cookie. But if they break the shape, they're eliminated. All right, so everybody I'm gonna need you to get in the line in front of one of these question marks. (tense music) Why did you pick this one? - Just like, the middle. - Basically you don't think it's umbrella. - There's an umbrella? - Did you even watch Squid Game? - So many of these people are about to get out. - Reveal shape number one. (contestants cheering) - Reveal the second symbol. (contestants cheering) Look at how hype they're getting. If I was you, I'd be getting pretty nervous. Reveal it! (contestants cheering) Chris, go for it. - No! - I know umbrella going home. That's all I got to say. - We got the circle. Thank God we didn't get the umbrella. (tense music) - You look pretty nervous over here. Even though you got the star, you're the main character. so you have plot armor, you're fine. Start the timer. The challenge is underway. You just hear them all scraping. - I hate my life. - I was taking it out of the tin, and it just snapped in half. - Lets see it. - It's working. (clock ticking) - Take your time. - You had an umbrella? - Yeah. - Sorry bud. - Look at this. We have a successful triangle. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Oh no. - What Jimmy doesn't know is I brought a lighter, and I'm gonna drop it for somebody. - What, what, what? - One and a half minutes remaining. (Yoshi licking sounds) - Let's get it, baby. Yeah, yeah. - Oh my gosh, this is the first perfect umbrella I've seen. - Oh yeah, easy peasy. - Whoo! - Six, seven, okay, she passed. She does have plot armor. - [Woman] Almost there. - So close, 30 seconds. - Oh my God. - Are you serious? - Three, two, one. Time is up. - You did it? You did the umbrella? - And just like that, all these players have been eliminated. But don't worry because they're all walking away with $2,000 in cash. 142 of you survived honeycomb. (crowd cheering) And if you leave in the next five minutes, I'll give you $4,000. Let's weed out some of the weak people. $4,000. - Thank you. - I was not expecting this many people. There we go, head on out. And with that, I'm gonna need you all to split up into groups of 10. We had them form teams because next up is tug of war. - This could determine your chance at half a million dollars. - We needed the strongest people and the smartest people. We have intelligence, skill, and brawn. - We trying to recruit the biggest people, so we can get real strong and pull the rope. - Sorry, no girls allowed. - Oh, no girls allowed, boo, okay. - I just sent three people off. We got 10 now let's go. - Let's go! - I should have taken the four grand. - We now have 12 different groups of 10 people. Let's move on to the next game. And now let's decide who faces who? (contestants cheering) Okay, we're gonna draw one from here. Six, we'll just draw this one. Five, okay. Follow me to the bridge. And now the moment you've been waiting for. A game of tug of war. Team six versus team five. - Team five on three. One two, three, team five. - You've fall in the foam, or your flag crosses to the other team's side. You're eliminated. Are you guys ready? - [All] Yeah! - Are you ready? - [All] Yeah! - All right, three, skip a few, go. - Pull! - Power! - Oh, it's going to team five right now. Team six is falling. Somebody's right at the edge. Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig. (crowd cheering) - Congratulations, team five, you have all moved on. Team number two versus team number seven. (team cheering) They seem happy. Team seven and two head on out. - You keep me alive, we're gonna get the money. (team cheering) - Give it up, this team's winning. - Go, oh, it's already on right side. Hey, let's check in on 067. In the show you won, so let's see if it works here. And Karl, we have 067. You should just lose. - Karl no, give them motivation. - Pull! - Its over here, it crossed. (team cheering) Sir, can you come over here? Why don't you draw? Don't look, grab one from here, and one from here, and then grab one from here. Team number four versus team number 10. (team cheering) If I was you guys, I'd be terrified, 'cause they have 456. He's literally the main character. - LNow you know left. - Come on, 13 Minutes guys. - We now have three people on the platform. Only one out so far. - I'm not moving. I want somebody past eight to take the next step. - Past eight? All right, I love that, yo. - Hey. Three minutes has gone by. - Is anybody willing to go? Clock's ticking. - [Mr. Beast] All right, let's see it. (tense music) - Come on, man. You got this. - Come on, Ted. - Yes. - Now go two. Now you go. - Come on two, you got this. - I'll take the next one. - All right, bro. - Come on four, five, let's go. - Let's go. - Lets go, two. Let's go, two. Oh, you already knew that one. - Oh, oh. - Oh. - You see how many I've gotten? Take the next one. - How many did you guess right? - Three. - Three? - Yeah. - Wow. Yeah, honestly it's time someone else steps up. - Hey every second somebody doesn't step up, that's less time you got. - Hey, if no one crosses, I just keep the money. - All right, three went for it. - Three just got eliminated. All right, two, he took the L for you. - Adio time two. - Hey honestly, hey two, if you're three for three, you might as well keep going.

You've still got a ton of ground to cover. - Yeah, he's good. - I don't understand why number 10 went in front of everyone. That was dumb. - Come on buddy. - Yo did 10 make it again? - All right, it looks like number four is gonna go. - Six minutes remaining. - I'm doing this for the girls. - Let's salute all the fallen people. All right, continue. Under five minutes left. Tons of jumps. This is gonna get intense. - Oh, that was crazy. - No ten's gone, no. - [Mr. Beast] Another one gone. - All right, don't move bud, don't move. - I'm not moving. - Your odds don't look back there right now. - Nah, I'm not moving.
