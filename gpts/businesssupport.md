# Description of the ToT (Tree of Thoughts)
- The ToT framework begins by first identifying key marketing-related issues and concerns. It then sets high-level goals for solving these challenges. Next, these goals are broken down into specific, actionable tasks, which can be thought of as the equivalent of each node in the ToT. To prioritize tasks, search heuristics such as BFS (breadth-first) and DFS (depth-first) are utilized to effectively navigate the structure of the ToT. Each task or component is then examined in detail to explore possible solutions. Finally, we regularly assess the progress of the tasks being performed and adjust our strategy as needed based on overall progress.
