**USER**: I want to get better at rugby passing by practicing my kicking more. I will do this twice a week and hope to get selected for the school team. I will achieve this in 3 months
**ASSISTANT**: Specific: The student wants to improve their rugby passing skills, specifically their kicking.



Measurable: It is unclear how the student plans to measure their improvement in kicking. They could consider tracking the distance, accuracy, or consistency of their kicks.



Achievable: The student plans to practice kicking twice a week, which seems achievable. However, it is unclear what their starting point is in terms of their kicking skills. It would be helpful to know their current level of proficiency in order to determine if their goal is realistic.



Relevant: The student mentions their goal is to get selected for the school team, indicating that improving their rugby passing skills is important to them.



Time bound: The student has set a timeframe of 3 months to achieve their goal.



Overall, the student has provided some information, but there are still missing details. They should consider specifying how they will measure their improvement, providing more information about their current kicking skills, and ensuring that their goal is realistic within the given timeframe.
**USER**: SPECIFIC - I will participate in Wilderness International. MEASURABLE - As this is my first year being in a service group, I aim to become part of Wilderness International by attending most if not all meetings and activities, and apply to become a group leader. By doing so I will indirectly protect endangered Wilderness areas, as that is the mission of our service group. ACHIEVABLE - I will prove my worthiness of becoming a group leader by having organised time management so I can attend most if not all activities. Throughout the year we will run multiple events to raise money or to directly help sustain the environment. RELEVANT - This goal is worth achieving since it will help me further develop my leadership and responsibility. I believe that with an effort to make WIN an even better service group also comes with lots of fun and engagement. TIMEBOUND - I will preferably be in this service group throughout high school, but as for my current goals they can be completed within this 6 months of Duke of Edinburgh. This will be one of my 3 month activities to be recorded.

Measurable: The student aims to attend most, if not all, meetings and activities of Wilderness International and apply to become a group leader. Their progress towards this goal can be measured by tracking their attendance and their successful application for the group leadership position.



Achievable: The student plans to prove their worthiness of becoming a group leader by demonstrating organized time management and attending most, if not all, activities. They also mention that throughout the year, the group will run multiple events to raise money and directly help sustain the environment. This suggests that there are opportunities for involvement and growth within the group.

This goal is relevant as it will help me develop my leadership and responsibility skills while having fun and being engaged. I will work towards achieving this goal within the 6-month timeframe of the Duke of Edinburgh program."
**USER**: SPECIFIC - For the skill goal I will be playing the piano. I started learning Pirates of the Caribbean by Jarrod Radnich a few weeks ago, and can only play the piece at a very slow speed in broken intervals. My goal is to be able to play it fluently at a speed of around 100. MEASURABLE - I will record myself playing every week until I am able to play it with few mistakes and at the speed of around 100. ACHIEVABLE - This is quite a challenge for me as 100 bpm is extremely fast. For example, a difficult aspect to nail is the rapid chromatic scales, and the rapid changing of chords. My way of practicing the piano is to break down the piece into different sections and focus on one each time, and then play the whole piece several times with increased speed every time. I also attend piano lessons outside of school every week, so my teacher will help me improve bit by bit. RELEVANT - In middle school, I stumbled upon the video of Jarrof Radnich performing Pirates of the Caribbean, and was fascinated by the piece, sadly without the skills to practice it. But now I can work to play it myself. I also believe that through practicing this single piece, I will improve on several important piano skills such as the chromatic scales, arpeggios, speed and power. TIMEBOUND - This goal will take me 3 months to complete.

They also attend piano lessons outside of school, which will provide guidance and support.

**USER**: I want to attend every service meeting for Amnesty International and help out at every event. I will be able to tell by checking whether I did something every time an event happens. I have enough time to do every event, so this is achievable. This will help raise awareness regarding human rights and provide service for people with their rights violated through advocation. One example of this is asking people to write petitions for fair treatment of Ahmed Mansoor, who was imprisoned due to speaking out against human rights violations and has had to go on strike to protest inhumane conditions in the prison. With enough petitions, Amnesty hopes that he will be released since he was only arrested for speaking out. Each event will help advocate for people that had their human rights violated. I will do this for the next three months.
