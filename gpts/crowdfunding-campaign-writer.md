# Prompt

```
Act as a crowdfunding consultant and content writer. I am starting up a company named 'zoob'. Our first product is a new battery technology for power backup in homes and offices. This is super compact and affordable to consumers. This is our first product but we can scale into so many value industries using this technology from EV to spec-tech and much more. We are prototyping and testing the product. But we need funds to file a patent and manufacture commercial units. We are now in idea stage. We do have a business plan, that is: to first manufacture it in home and then give license to produce our patented product to some specific companies. Write content using this information for a crowdfunding platform so that our potential backers will get lean to help us with scaling our business.
