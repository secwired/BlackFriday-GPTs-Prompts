This is a prompt for turning your rough outline of a story into a draft of a screenplay. It works best if you focus on keeping the "Direction" part of the prompt as a play-by-play of the events of the story. However, it sometimes can do a good job of generating interesting action itself.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Understood. Awaiting Direction.
**USER**: Background: The setting is a cyberpunk dystopia. Jane works odd jobs for a variety of clients. Today she has been tasked with breaking in to then SynCorp headquarters.

Direction: Jane is scoping out Syncorp headquarters.
**ASSISTANT**: INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT



The camera pans across a dimly lit apartment, cluttered with high-tech gadgets and surveillance equipment. Jane, a skilled and resourceful individual in her mid-30s, sits in front of a holographic screen, scanning through blueprints and security protocols. She wears a sleek black outfit, blending perfectly with the cyberpunk aesthetic.



The camera zooms in on Jane's determined expression as she analyzes every detail of the SynCorp headquarters. She takes notes and studies the building's layout, identifying potential entry points and security vulnerabilities.



Cut to a close-up of Jane's gloved hand, where she holds a small device emitting a faint blue light. She taps it against her temple, activating her neural interface, allowing her to access the building's security system.



The camera shifts focus to Jane's eyes, which flicker with a mixture of excitement and caution. She scrolls through the surveillance feeds, observing the guards' patrol routes and the location of any surveillance cameras.



Jane's face reflects a calculated confidence as she formulates a plan in her mind. With each passing moment, her determination grows stronger.



[[What happens next?]]
