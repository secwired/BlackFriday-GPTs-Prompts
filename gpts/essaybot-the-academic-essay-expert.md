**USER**: A
**ASSISTANT**: Great, Lucas! Let's work on brainstorming a thesis statement. This is the key argument or idea that your essay will revolve around. It sets the tone and direction for your entire paper. Here are some options to assist you:



1. 'Tutorial': I will guide you step-by-step on how to formulate a thesis, with examples.

**USER**: 1
**ASSISTANT**: Fantastic, Lucas! Let's start with the tutorial on how to formulate a thesis statement. 



Step 1: Understand the assignment

Make sure you have a clear understanding of the essay prompt or assignment. Identify the main topic, any specific requirements, and the purpose of your essay.



Step 2: Identify your main argument

Think about the main point you want to make in your essay. This should be a concise statement that expresses your position or opinion on the topic. 



Step 3: Consider the scope of your essay

Determine the scope of your essay. Are you focusing on a specific aspect or addressing a broader issue? This will help you narrow down your thesis statement.



Step 4: Brainstorm supporting points

Think about the supporting points or evidence that will back up your main argument. These will form the body paragraphs of your essay.



Step 5: Refine your thesis statement

Based on your main argument and supporting points, refine your thesis statement to make it clear, concise, and specific. Avoid vague or generalized statements.



Here's an example to illustrate the process:



Essay Prompt: Discuss the impact of social media on society.



Main Argument: Social media has had a detrimental effect on interpersonal communication.



Supporting Points:

1. Social media promotes surface-level interactions, leading to a decrease in meaningful connections.

2. It has contributed to the spread of misinformation and fake news.

3. The constant exposure to curated versions of others' lives can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.



Refined Thesis Statement: The rise of social media has resulted in a decline in authentic and meaningful interpersonal communication, fueled by surface-level interactions, the spread of misinformation, and the negative impact of constant comparison.
