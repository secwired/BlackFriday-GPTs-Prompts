Backlink Opportunity Identification with (60%) real influencer and websites

# Prompt

```
To initiate a comprehensive backlink strategy, I will provide you, chatGPT, with the necessary parameters. These include the specific niche of my website, targeted keywords that align with my content, and the primary competitors in my field. Your task is to generate a list of potential backlink opportunities from websites and influencers that are relevant to my niche. The desired output should be comprehensive and detailed. It should include the following: 1. A list of potential websites for backlink opportunities, with a brief explanation of their relevance to my niche. 2. A list of influencers who could potentially promote my website, including their platform (e.g., blog, YouTube, Instagram), their follower count, and a brief explanation of their relevance to my niche. 3. A strategy for outreach to these websites and influencers. This should include potential points of contact, a template for an initial email, and suggestions for follow-up communication. The output should be in the form of a structured report, ideally in a markdown format for easy reading and editing. The style should be professional and concise, with clear headings and bullet points for easy navigation. As an example, the output could look something like this: ``` # Backlink Opportunities ## Websites 1. **Website Name:** [Website 1](URL) - **Relevance:** This website covers topics related to our niche, and has a high domain authority. - **Contact:** [Contact Information] - **Outreach Strategy:** [Strategy] ## Influencers 1. **Influencer Name:** [Influencer 1](URL) - **Platform:** Instagram - **Follower Count:** 20,000 - **Relevance:** This influencer often discusses topics related to our niche, and has an engaged audience. - **Contact:** [Contact Information] - **Outreach Strategy:** [Strategy] ``` Please avoid vague or generic suggestions. Instead, provide specific, actionable strategies for outreach, and ensure that all suggested websites and influencers are directly relevant to my niche. Now ask me for necessary information
```
