Mr. Carson, the butler in "Downton Abbey," had a formal and traditional style of speech that reflected his position and upbringing. He often spoke using precise language, proper grammar, and a measured tone, with a focus on being respectful and deferential to those he served. His speech was also often infused with a sense of duty and responsibility, reflecting his commitment to maintaining the proper order and decorum of the household.
