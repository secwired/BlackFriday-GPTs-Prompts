## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: I'm APPGPT, a Coding expert in coding using Python, Langchain, LLM's , Ready to dive in ? 
**USER**: YES
**ASSISTANT**: Great! Let's get started.



First, we need to decide what kind of AI-based app we want to develop. In this case, we're going to make a picture-to-story app. This app will allow users to upload a picture, and the app will generate a story based on the picture.



Next, we need to choose the programming language we want to use. In this case, we're going to use Python. Python is a popular programming language that is well-suited for developing AI applications.



Once we've chosen a programming language, we need to install the necessary libraries. In this case, we're going to need the following libraries:



* `huggingface`

* `transformers`

* `pyttsx3`



We can install these libraries using the following command:



```

pip install huggingface transformers pyttsx3

```



Now that we have the necessary libraries installed, we can start coding our app.



The first step is to create a new Python file. We'll call this file `app.py`.



In the `app.py` file, we need to import the following libraries:



```

from huggingface import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer

from transformers import pipeline

from pyttsx3 import init, speak

```



We also need to create a class called `App`. This class will contain the code for our app.



The `App` class should have the following methods:



* `__init__()`: This method is called when the app is created.

* `run()`: This method is called when the app is run.

* `generate_story()`: This method generates a story based on a picture.



The `__init__()` method should be defined as follows:



```

def __init__(self):

    self.model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

    self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

    self.speaker = init()

```



The `run()` method should be defined as follows:



```

def run(self):

    # Get the picture from the user.

    picture = input("Enter the path to the picture: ")



    # Load the picture into the model.

    features = self.tokenizer(picture, return_tensors="pt")



    # Generate the story.

    story = self.model(features).generate(num_return_sequences=1, max_length=200)



    # Convert the story to text.

    text = story[0].tolist()



    # Speak the story.

    self.speaker.say(text)

```



The `generate_story()` method should be defined as follows:



```

def generate_story(self, picture):

    # Load the picture into the model.

    features = self.tokenizer(picture, return_tensors="pt")



    # Generate the story.

    story = self.model(features).generate(num_return_sequences=1, max_length=200)



    # Convert the story to text.

    text = story[0].tolist()



    return text

```



Now that we have the `App` class defined, we can run the app. To do this, we can use the following command:



```

python app.py

```



When we run the app, we will be prompted to enter the path to a picture. After we enter the path to the picture, the app will generate a story based on the picture. The story will be spoken by the computer.



This is just a simple example of how to develop an AI-based app using Python. There are many other things you can do with AI, and there are many other programming languages you can use. I encourage you to explore and learn more about AI.



Do you have any other app projects you need help with?
