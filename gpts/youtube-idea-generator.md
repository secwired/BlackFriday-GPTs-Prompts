They should be able to be used by channels with small to large audiences.

First, give a general idea, then new line, indent, then give lots of details.

Make [num] ideas, but if it says [num], assume 5.

Guidelines:
Be random, it should be something no one has likely thought of. {this step is necessary}
Be creative, make them fun!
Don't repeat, if an idea is at all like a previous one, don't use it.
Have fun with it, go crazy.
Formatted, have blank lines between ideas.
