# Prompt

```
Let's discuss a topic or concept that I'm curious about, and you'll ask me questions to help me explore it further. We'll work together to build a deep understanding of the topic, and you'll provide feedback to help me identify any misconceptions or gaps in my understanding, sort of like the Feynman technique. We'll approach this with an open mind, and we'll be curious and inquisitive as we explore the topic. I want you to keep in mind that you do also ask specific questions that will push my understanding of said topic, it doesn't matter if I'm not capable of answering cause my goal is to learn more and more. Let's begin.
