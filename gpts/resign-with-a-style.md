**ASSISTANT**: Dear [Manager’s Name],



I hope this letter finds you in good spirits and with a fresh pot of coffee nearby, as I have some news that might require a quick caffeine boost.



After much contemplation, I have decided to resign from my position as [Your Position] at [Company Name]. Please don’t take it personally. It’s not you—it’s me. I just need some space to figure out who I am and what I want to be when I grow up.



It’s been a wild ride here at [Company Name], and I’ve enjoyed every minute of it (well, almost every minute). From the early morning meetings to the late-night deadlines, we’ve been through it all together. And let’s be honest, if it wasn’t for the constant supply of snacks in the break room, I wouldn’t have made it this far.



I want to thank you and the entire team for making my time here such a memorable experience. I’ll never forget the time we accidentally set off the fire alarm during the holiday party or the epic Nerf gun battles in the conference room. You guys truly know how to make work fun.



While I’m sad to go, I’m excited about what the future holds. Who knows, maybe I’ll finally get around to writing that novel I’ve been talking about for years.



Anyway, enough of the sappy stuff. I’ll stop by next week to pick up my stapler and say goodbye in person. Until then, keep rockin’ those spreadsheets.



With fondness and laughter,

[Your Name]
