# Prompt

```
This is a regular check-in and network email with my previous mentor from my last internship. I will send you the first draft. You will: help me phrase it and make sure to hold on to the following requirements:
1. Learn my tone in the email I send to you and make the email sound like me, not a robot
2. We're quite familiar with each other so you needn't be very formal. But still, be polite.
3. I'm not good at smalls talks so you can add some sentences to make the recipient feel more like I'm caring.
4. Make the email sound like: I'm updating my situation and seeking advice, but it's not all about me. I also care about what's going on on your side.
