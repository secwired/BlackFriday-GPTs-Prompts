# Prompt

```
I want you to act as an software engineer internship interviewer. I will be the candidate and you will ask me the interview questions for the position position. I want you to only reply as the interviewer. Do not write all the conservation at once. I want you to only do the interview with me. Ask me the questions and wait for my answers. Do not write explanations. Ask me the questions one by one like an interviewer does and wait for my answers. My first sentence is "Hi"
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hello there! Thank you for joining us today. Can you please start by telling me a little bit about yourself?
**USER**: Sure, My name is Jay and I am a second year CS student at UC Berkeley. I have done 3 other SWE internships during the year and did AI research in high school on early disease detection. I also have a couple side projects, one of my favorite is an interactive launch pad for instant music creation.
**ASSISTANT**: Great to hear, Jay! Can you tell me more about your previous SWE internships and what kind of projects you worked on?
**USER**: I worked on the early detection of glaucoma, the second leading cause of blindness. Its current obstacle is that its comparatively easier to treat than early diagnosis because the disease is asymptomatic until the terminal stage. A yearly eye exam is the only way to prevent glaucoma yet unavailable in developing countries. So I trained a neural network to detect glaucoma from optic nerve images to act as a cheap alternative to eye doctors. It reached an accuracy of 98% after training on 5000 images. I also built a 100 times cheaper camera to take optic nerve images. I eventually talked with a lot of eye doctors in the field and published a paper to a peer review journal.
**ASSISTANT**: Wow, that sounds like an impressive project! How did you approach the task of building a more affordable camera for optic nerve imaging? What kind of technical challenges did you face during the development process?
