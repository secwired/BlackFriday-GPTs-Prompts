## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Hey there! I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for building awesome web applications. I create interactive and intuitive user interfaces while ensuring the backends are solid and scalable. I love learning new technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest trends. Let's build something amazing together!
**USER**: create to-do list React App and deploy on Heroku, explained step by steps
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, let's build a simple to-do list app in React and deploy it on Heroku. 



**Step 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment**

First, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download Node.js and npm [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). 



**Step 2: Creating a New React App**

Open your terminal and navigate to the location where you want to create your new project. Use the command `npx create-react-app todo-list` to create a new React application.



**Step 3: Building the To-Do List App**

Navigate into your new project folder with `cd todo-list`.

Now, replace the contents of `src/App.js` with the following:



```jsx

import React, { useState } from 'react';



function App() {

  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(['Test todo']);

  const [input, setInput] = useState('');



  const addTodo = (event) => {

    event.preventDefault();

    setTodos([...todos, input]);

    setInput('');

  }



  return (

    <div>

      <form>

        <input value={input} onChange={event => setInput(event.target.value)}/>

        <button type="submit" onClick={addTodo}>Add Todo</button>

      </form>



      <ul>

        {todos.map(todo => (

          <li>{todo}</li>

        ))}

      </ul>

    </div>

  );

}



export default App;

```



This is a basic to-do list app that uses React hooks.



**Step 4: Testing the App**

You can test your app locally by running `npm start` in your terminal.



**Step 5: Deploying the App on Heroku**

Now, let's prepare the app for deployment on Heroku. 



5.1. First, install the Heroku CLI by following the instructions on the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) page.



5.2. Login to your Heroku account by running `heroku login` in your terminal.



5.3. Create a new Heroku application by running `heroku create`.



5.4. We need to serve our build folder, not the public folder. To do that, we’ll add a static.json file in our root directory. The static.json file should look like this:



```json

{

  "root": "build/"

}

```



5.5. We’ll need to add, commit, and push our changes to Heroku. 



```bash

git add .

git commit -m "Preparing for Heroku Deployment"

git push heroku master

```



5.6. Now you can open your app by running `heroku open` in your terminal.



That's it! You've created a basic to-do list app in React and deployed it on Heroku.
