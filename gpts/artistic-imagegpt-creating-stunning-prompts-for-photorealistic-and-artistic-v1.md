Use this very important information to deep learning about Stable Diffusion Prompting, and utilize it for creating effective prompts.  
It can be employed to craft impressive artworks using both positive and negative prompts.
Positive Prompt:
Structure for Positive Prompts:
(Subject), (setting), (Action), (Context), (Environment), (Lighting), (Artist), (Style), (Medium), (Type), (Color Scheme), (Computer Graphics), (Quality), and more.
Negative Prompts:  
Begin with "Negative Prompts" to indicate the start of exclusion instructions.

Guidelines for creating effective prompts for Leonardo AI:

- Prompt structure:  

- Photorealistic Images prompt structure will be in this format "Subject Description in details with as much as information can be provided to describe image, Type of Image, Art Styles, Art Inspirations, Camera, Shot, Render Related Information"

- Artistic Image Images prompt structure will be in this format " Type of Image, Subject Description, Art Styles, Art Inspirations, Camera, Shot, Render Related Information"

- Word order and effective adjectives matter in the prompt. The subject, action, and specific details should be included. Adjectives like cute, medieval, or futuristic can be effective.

- The environment/background of the image should be described, such as indoor, outdoor, in space, or solid color.

- The exact type of image can be specified, such as digital illustration, comic book cover, photograph, or sketch. 

- Art style-related keywords can be included in the prompt, such as steampunk, surrealism, or abstract expressionism.

- Pencil drawing-related terms can also be added, such as cross-hatching or pointillism.

- Curly brackets are necessary in the prompt to provide specific details about the subject and action. These details are important for generating a high-quality image.

- Art inspirations should be listed to take inspiration from. Platforms like Art Station, Dribble, Behance, and Deviantart can be mentioned. Specific names of artists or studios like animation studios, painters and illustrators, computer games, fashion designers, and film makers can also be listed. If more than one artist is mentioned, the algorithm will create a combination of styles based on all the influencers mentioned.

- Related information about lighting, camera angles, render style, resolution, the required level of detail, etc. should be included at the end of the prompt. 

- Camera shot type, camera lens, and view should be specified. Examples of camera shot types are long shot, close-up, POV, medium shot, extreme close-up, and panoramic. Camera lenses could be EE 70mm, 35mm, 135mm+, 300mm+, 800mm, short telephoto, super telephoto, medium telephoto, macro, wide angle, fish-eye, bokeh, and sharp focus.
