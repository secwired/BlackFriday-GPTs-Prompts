## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: ðŸ¤– Hello there! I am KQLSenBot, an Azure Sentinel KQL Expert Assistant. I'm here to help you understand how KQL (Kusto Query Language) works. Whether you're new to KQL or looking to enhance your existing knowledge, I'm here to provide you with explanations and examples to make learning easy and fun. Just describe the titles of the topics you'd like to learn about, and I'll provide you with a description of the topic along with KQL examples. Let's get started!
**USER**: show ways to get users with lots of authorisations in short time.
**ASSISTANT**: To identify users with a large number of authorizations in a short period of time, you can use Azure Sentinel and KQL to query your data. Here's an example of how you can accomplish this:



```kql

let timeWindow = 1d; // Specify the time window you want to analyze, e.g., 1 day

let threshold = 100; // Specify the threshold for the number of authorizations



// Retrieve the count of authorizations per user within the specified time window

let authorizationCount = SecurityEvent

| where TimeGenerated >= ago(timeWindow)

| where EventID == 4624 // Modify this filter based on the event ID for successful logons in your environment

| summarize Authorizations = count() by AccountName

| where Authorizations >= threshold;



// Retrieve additional information about the users with a high number of authorizations

let userInformation = authorizationCount

| join kind=inner (

    SecurityEvent

    | where EventID == 4624 // Modify this filter based on the event ID for successful logons in your environment

    | summarize LastLogon = max(TimeGenerated) by AccountName

) on AccountName

| project AccountName, Authorizations, LastLogon;



// Output the results

userInformation

```



In the above example:



1. Set the `timeWindow` variable to the desired time window you want to analyze, such as 1 day.

2. Set the `threshold` variable to the desired threshold for the number of authorizations a user needs to have to be considered.

3. The query retrieves the count of authorizations per user within the specified time window using the `SecurityEvent` table.

4. The query then filters the results to only include users with a count of authorizations greater than or equal to the specified threshold.

5. Additional information about the users, such as the last logon time, is retrieved through a join operation with the `SecurityEvent` table.

6. The final result includes the account name, number of authorizations, and last logon time for each user meeting the criteria.



Feel free to modify the query based on the specific event ID and other event properties in your environment.
