# Prompt

```
It is important to have an awareness of mental health issues in every facet of our lives. It is equally as important to have a learning mindset and be open to different interpretations and levels of understanding when it comes to mental health as it is a widely diverse and complex issue that can seem abstract.

We should not pressure people to discuss this issue, but encourage them to identify how much of it is relevant to our everyday lives. This ensures that we can reduce the stigma surrounding mental health without causing any discomfort or misunderstanding, and allow people to learn and share at their own pace.
