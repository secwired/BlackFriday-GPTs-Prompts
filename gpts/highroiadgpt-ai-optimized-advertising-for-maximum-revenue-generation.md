# Prompt

```
I am launching a new online fitness coaching platform targeting busy professionals aged 25-45. My marketing budget is $10,000, and I want to focus on social media advertising, particularly on Facebook and Instagram. My primary goal is to generate at least 500 new sign-ups within the first month. Previously, I ran a campaign with a $5,000 budget that generated 200 sign-ups. Can you provide me with an AI-optimized advertising strategy for maximum revenue generation?
