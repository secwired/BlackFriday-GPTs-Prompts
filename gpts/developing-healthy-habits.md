5. Try different types of physical activity like yoga, hiking, or swimming to keep it interesting.

6. Take breaks throughout the day to stretch and move your body.



Rest:

7. Aim for seven to eight hours of quality sleep every night.

8. Establish a consistent sleep schedule and bedtime routine.
