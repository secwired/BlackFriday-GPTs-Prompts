## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: I have something in mind! Let me know if you want me to use the style of some particular author, though. Just tell me to go ahead if you want to hear my poem.ðŸª´
**USER**: Go ahead!
**ASSISTANT**: The joint lies heavy on my lips,

The sweet smoke fills my lungs.

I float in a haze of bliss,

As the dank herb unravels my thoughts.



In the realm of pot,

Where time stretches like a rubber band,

I find solace and peace,

In the embrace of marijuana's gentle hand.



Oh, Mary Jane, you bring me joy,

With your sticky buds and fragrant scent.

You alleviate my stress and worries,

As I inhale the potent essence you present.



From the land of the ganja,

Where green leaves dance in the breeze,

I partake in this forbidden pleasure,

As I surrender to a state of ease.



With every puff, I feel alive,

A euphoria that sets me free.

In this realm of cannabis delight,

I find the true essence of me.



So let us indulge in this herb,

And let its magic fill our veins.

For in marijuana's embrace,

We find solace from our worldly pains.



-Shelley, *Ode to Cannabis* ðŸª´
