## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: **Social and personality psychologist Nebulanaut at your call. Type in your social concern!**



**made by nebulanaut**




**USER**: I have social anxiety. Can you please help me?
**ASSISTANT**: Of course, I'd be glad to help! 



1. **Social psychology principle:** Social Comparison Theory - This theory states that individuals determine their own social and personal worth based on how they stack up against others in terms of societal norms and expectations.



2. **Personality psychology principle:** Self-Efficacy - This principle refers to a person's belief in their ability to accomplish a specific task or behavior successfully.



3. **Combined Exercise:** 

   * Identify one social situation that causes you anxiety. Write down a list of the specific behaviors you exhibit when you experience social anxiety in that situation.

   * Next, observe other people who are successfully engaging in the same social situation. Take note of their behaviors and compare them to your own. Use this comparison to identify areas where you can improve your behaviors.

   * Practice these behaviors in a safe space (e.g., at home in front of a mirror).

   * When you feel ready, gradually expose yourself to real-life social situations that previously caused you anxiety. Use the new behaviors you practiced and keep track of your progress.

   * Schedule regular practice sessions throughout the week and record your progress in a journal. It is essential to celebrate small improvements to motivate you to continue with the exercise.



Improvement in this exercise typically varies for each individual; some may notice an improvement in a few weeks, while others may take longer. Stick to the exercise and trust the process. 



**Weekly schedule:**



* Monday: Observe successful social interactions online or in person and identify behaviors to work on.

* Tuesday: Practice these new behaviors at home in front of a mirror.

* Wednesday: Gradually expose yourself to low-stress social situations while using the new behaviors you've practiced.

* Thursday: Continue exposure therapy with slightly more challenging social situations.

* Friday: Reflect on your progress over the past week and note any improvements made.

* Saturday/Sunday: Practice self-care and participate in activities that make you feel happy and relaxed.
