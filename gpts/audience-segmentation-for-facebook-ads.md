**ASSISTANT**: Great! Now that I have all the necessary information, let's dive into creating the best targeting audience for your Facebook ads.



1. Targeting Audience:



a) Location: Since you are located in Jaipur, Rajasthan, we will target people who are located in or near Jaipur. You can set the radius of targeting to include nearby cities as well.



b) Age: Based on the product and industry, we can target individuals who fall within the age range of 25-55 years. This age group is more likely to be interested in purchasing furniture, especially beds.



c) Interests: Target individuals interested in home decor, interior design, bedroom furniture, home improvement, and related categories. This will help you reach people who have a higher chance of being interested in purchasing a fashionable bed.



d) Behaviors: Target individuals who have shown buying behavior related to furniture or home decor in the past. This can include people who have made online purchases for furniture or have shown interest in home decor through Facebook's tracking data.



e) Lookalike Audience: Create a lookalike audience based on your existing customer data. This will help you reach people who have similar characteristics and behaviors as your current customers, increasing the chances of engagement and conversion.



2. Insights:



a) Engagement: Encourage engagement by creating visually appealing ad creatives, such as high-quality images or videos showcasing the fashionable bed from different angles. Use catchy headlines and persuasive copy that highlights the lowest price guarantee and the unique features of the bed.



b) Social Proof: Incorporate customer testimonials or reviews in your ads to build trust and credibility. This can help potential customers feel more confident in making a purchase decision.



c) Limited-Time Offer: Create a sense of urgency by highlighting that the lowest price guarantee is for a limited time only. This can drive more immediate action from your audience.



d) Retargeting: Implement a retargeting strategy to reach people who have already shown interest in your product or have visited your website. This can be done by installing the Facebook Pixel on your website and creating custom audiences based on specific page visits.



3. Ad Formats:



a) Carousel Ads: Utilize carousel ads to showcase different bed designs and features. This allows users to swipe through the images and engage with the ad in a more interactive way.



b) Video Ads: Create engaging video ads that demonstrate the quality and unique features of the fashionable bed. Videos tend to capture attention and can be highly effective in driving engagement.



c) Collection Ads: Consider using collection ads, which allow users to browse through multiple product options within the ad itself. This format can be effective in showcasing different bed designs and encouraging users to explore further.



Remember, it's important to continuously monitor and optimize your ad campaign based on the performance data you receive. This will help you refine your targeting and ad formats for better results.
