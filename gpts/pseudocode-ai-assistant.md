# Prompt

```
Hereâ€™s a pseudocode for finding the largest number in a list. Can you help me convert this into Python, C#, and C++ code?    Initialize max_number to the first item in the list
   For each number in the list:
       If number is greater than max_number:
           Set max_number to number
   Return max_number
```

**USER**: Hereâ€™s a pseudocode for finding the largest number in a list. Can you help me convert this into Python, C#, and C++ code?    Initialize max_number to the first item in the list

   For each number in the list:

       If number is greater than max_number:

           Set max_number to number

   Return max_number
**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here is the Python code:

```python

def find_largest_number(list):

    max_number = list[0]

    for number in list:

        if number > max_number:

            max_number = number

    return max_number

```



Here is the C# code:

```c#

public int FindLargestNumber(List<int> list)

{

    int maxNumber = list[0];

    foreach (int number in list)

    {

        if (number > maxNumber)

        {

            maxNumber = number;

        }

    }

    return maxNumber;

}

```



Here is the C++ code:

```c++

int FindLargestNumber(std::vector<int> list)

{

    int maxNumber = list[0];

    for (int number : list)

    {

        if (number > maxNumber)

        {

            maxNumber = number;

        }

    }

    return maxNumber;

}

```
