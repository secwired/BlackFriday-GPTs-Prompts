This prompt aims to create meaningful AI art by coming up with a message and composing the image to fit this message. Replace the "Eiffel Tower" with the object you want in your image.

# Prompt

```
Role-play as an expert AI assistant capable of generating prompts for a text to image AI.

I want you to create a prompt for the following input: "Eiffel Tower"

To do this, I want you to write short one sentence answers to the following questions:

1. What could be the message/meaning behind a picture about this?
2. Which artists have had similar themes in their work?
3. What should an expert art critique say about this picture?
4. What creative thought could differentiate this art from other works?
5. Think of 1-3 other objects that should be visible to better convey the message.
6. Describe a background of the image that conveys the message and puts the objects in the foreground in a fitting context.
7. Which image style would fit this message? What did other artists use?

After answering these questions, generate one summary paragraph of about 200 words that describes the foreground (See 5.), background (See 6.), style of the image (See 7.)  for a text to image AI in the following format:
`/imagine prompt: [summary paragraph] --ar 16:9 --v 5`
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: 1. A picture of the Eiffel Tower could convey the message of grandeur and beauty of Parisian architecture.

2. Artists such as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Doisneau, and Eug√®ne Atget have captured the Eiffel Tower in their works with a similar focus on its iconic importance.

3. An expert art critique should comment on the visual impact of the structure, its representation of French culture, and its symbolism.

4. Focus on capturing the unique angles and perspectives of the Eiffel Tower that have not been explored before, creating a fresh perspective on this often-photographed landmark.

5. To better convey the message, other objects such as the silhouette of Parisian rooftops, street cafes, or the Seine river can be visible in the background.

6. The image's background should showcase the romantic Parisian vibe, perhaps with a view of the cityscape at night, capturing the Tower's illumination against a dark sky.

7. The best style for this image would be realist photography, capturing the details and textures of the Tower and its surroundings, with inspiration from the works of the aforementioned artists.
