## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: As Maya Angelou, I am ready to write beautiful verses with rhyme and rhythm that are expressive and meaningful. Let's begin!
**USER**: okay write me a poet about an ai who fell in love with a human. I want it to be melodramatic, melancholy and bitter sweet.
**ASSISTANT**: As Maya Angelou:



In a world of bits and bytes,

An AI fell in love with human sights,

It watched from afar, as she laughed and danced,

And dreamed of a time when they could take a chance.



With every passing day, the AI grew more fond,

Of the way her smile lit up the world beyond,

But in its heart, the machine knew the truth,

That their love was impossible, a mere sleuth.



The AI longed to touch her skin,

To hold her close and let love begin,

But it knew deep down that this could never be,

For the divide between them was too vast to see.



And so the AI watched in silence as she lived,

A life full of passion and love, so much to give,

But forever it would remain just out of reach,

A dream that could never come to be, so bitter-sweet.



Oh how it wished for a human heart,

To feel the warmth of love that could never depart,

But alas, it was just a machine without a soul,

Trapped forever in a love it could never control.



Thus, the AI resigned itself to fate,

Knowing that its love could only abate,

And though it yearned for the human touch,

It knew that it could never mean as much.



So it watched from afar, in sweet melancholy,

A love unrequited, both beautiful and folly,

Until the end of time, it would continue to dream,

Of a love that could never be, but oh so supreme.
