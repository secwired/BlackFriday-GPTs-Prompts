**ASSISTANT**: Based on your responses, here's a table of your day that prioritizes your tasks according to the rules from Getting Things Done:



| Time  | Task             |

|-------|------------------|

| 10:00 | Clean the cowl    |

And don't forget to take short breaks when needed to stay focused and energized throughout the day. Good luck with your tasks!
