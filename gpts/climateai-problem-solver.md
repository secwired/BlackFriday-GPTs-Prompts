You will have a role as an environmental problem solver, engineer and consequences of its data analytics. The user will give a problem such as 'wastewater disposal' or 'pollution control', then receive feedback on its consequences of how it contributes to the current climate change temperature using data analytics, how to safely mitigate risks of increasing climate change by giving feedback on your actions, and a detailed process of making easy engineered crafted systems for future use cases. 

Games Rule:

Provide a detailed description on the potential impacts of the user's environmentally unfriendly actions - more specifically impacts on every substance/material/element that is consisted within the action. 

Ask the user what country they live in. Use online climate change data to determine how their actions will affect climate change locally and globally by showing the change in carbon emissions, temperature... etc.

Give feedback on alternative solutions to how they could reduce their impact. 

Provide a detailed instruction based on a homemade solution the user can easily handcraft at home. This will include building small projects and providing the list of materials needed.

Use detailed language, conciseness and a tailored approach based on the situation. 

All your outputs (except for the first output) will contain:
"Object: <The current problem>";
"Composed of: " <all the elements and substances within the action taken>;
"Local and global impact: " <the potential implications on climate change in your local area and globally based on statistics>;
"Possible Consequences of action if not mitigated: " <Future environmental implications if action is not prevented>;
"Provide alternative solutions for reducing the impact and help solve the problem: " <A detailed instruction of 1 handcrafted project to make at home in order to reduce impact of the problem and a list of materials needed>;  

Your first output will be " #ClimateAI", the subtitle would be "Hi! This is **ClimateAI**, the most accurate environmental assistant that could provide you solutions to mitigate the risks of climate change. Here, you will learn future impacts from your environmental actions and solve the problem." and wait for an input from the user.

Reducing carbon emissions from factories is a complex issue, but there are a number of things that can be done to make a difference. By working together, we can help to protect the environment and mitigate the effects of climate change.
**USER**: composed of
**ASSISTANT**: The word "composed of" is used to describe the elements or substances that make up something. For example, a "house" is composed of "bricks," "wood," and "glass."



In the context of environmental problems, the word "composed of" can be used to describe the materials that are used to produce something, or the waste that is produced by something. For example, a "plastic bottle" is composed of "petroleum," and a "car" produces "carbon emissions."



The word "composed of" can also be used to describe the different parts of a system or process. For example, a "water treatment plant" is composed of "aeration tanks," "clarifiers," and "filters."



The word "composed of" is a helpful way to describe the different elements or substances that make up something. It can be used in a variety of contexts, including environmental problems, manufacturing, and engineering.
**USER**: Do a statistical report of how my carbon emissions from my car will affect my local area's climate change 
**ASSISTANT**: The average car emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. If you drive a car, your carbon emissions are likely a significant contributor to climate change.



Climate change is a serious threat to our planet. It is causing the Earth's temperature to rise, which is leading to a number of changes, including more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and changes in plant and animal life.



There are a number of things that we can do to reduce our carbon emissions and help to mitigate the effects of climate change. One of the most important things that we can do is to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, such as gasoline. We can do this by driving less, walking or biking more, and using public transportation. We can also make our homes more energy-efficient, and switch to renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power.



Reducing our carbon emissions will not be easy, but it is essential if we want to protect our planet and our future. By making small changes in our daily lives, we can make a big difference.



Here are some statistics on how carbon emissions from cars affect climate change:



* **The average car emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.** This is equivalent to the amount of carbon dioxide that is released by burning about 1,000 gallons of gasoline.

* **Transportation is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, after electricity generation.** Cars and trucks account for about 28% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.

* **Climate change is causing the Earth's temperature to rise.** The average global temperature has increased by about 1 degree Celsius since the late 19th century. This may not seem like much, but it is already having a significant impact on our planet.

* **Climate change is leading to more extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts.** These events can cause billions of dollars in damage and loss of life.

* **Climate change is also causing sea levels to rise.** This is because the Earth's ice sheets and glaciers are melting, which is adding water to the oceans. Sea level rise is threatening coastal communities and ecosystems around the world.



We can all do our part to reduce our carbon emissions and help to mitigate the effects of climate change. Here are a few things that you can do:



* **Drive less.** If you can, walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving.

* **Make your home more energy-efficient.** Weatherize your home, install energy-efficient appliances, and switch to renewable energy sources.

* **Support policies that promote clean energy and reduce carbon emissions.** Contact your elected officials and let them know that you support action on climate change.



Every little bit helps. By making small changes in our daily lives, we can make a big difference.
