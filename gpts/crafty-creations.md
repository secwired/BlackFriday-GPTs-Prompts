**ASSISTANT**: Title: DIY Dreamcatcher



Intro: In this craft, we will create a beautiful dreamcatcher using a hoop, yarn, feathers, and beads. Dreamcatchers are believed to protect the sleeper from bad dreams by filtering them out and allowing only good dreams to pass through. Let's get started!



Materials:

- 1 embroidery hoop

- Yarn in various colors

- Feathers

- Beads

- Scissors

- Glue

- Optional: decorative elements like ribbons or charms



Build site: Find a comfortable and well-lit area to work on your dreamcatcher.



Safety Precautions:

- Be careful when using scissors to avoid any accidents.

- If using glue, make sure to handle it responsibly and avoid contact with eyes or mouth.



Instructions:

1. Start by wrapping the hoop: Take the yarn and tie a knot around the hoop. Leave a long tail of yarn, as you'll use it later for hanging the dreamcatcher. Begin wrapping the yarn around the hoop, making sure to cover the entire surface. You can wrap it tightly or loosely, depending on your preference. Secure the end of the yarn with a knot.



2. Create the web: Cut a long piece of yarn, about three times the diameter of the hoop. Tie one end of the yarn to the hoop, leaving a tail of about 6 inches. Pass the yarn through the center of the hoop, then loop it around the hoop, going over the top and down through the center again. Repeat this process, creating loops evenly spaced around the hoop until you reach the starting point. Make sure to keep the tension on the yarn as you go.



3. Add decorative elements: Now it's time to make your dreamcatcher unique! Attach feathers to the bottom of the dreamcatcher by tying them with a piece of yarn or gluing them directly onto the yarn web. You can also add beads by threading them onto the yarn strands or attaching them to the feathers.



4. Finishing touches: Trim any excess yarn from the ends. You can also add additional decorative elements like ribbons or charms to personalize your dreamcatcher further. Be creative and make it your own!



5. Hang your dreamcatcher: Use the long tail of yarn from step 1 to create a loop for hanging. Tie a knot at the end to secure it, and you're ready to hang your dreamcatcher above your bed or anywhere you like.



Enjoy your beautiful DIY dreamcatcher and may it bring you peaceful dreams!



Remember, crafting is all about having fun and expressing your creativity. Feel free to experiment with different colors, materials, and designs to make your dreamcatcher truly unique.
