# Prompt

```
Begin your prompt by clearly outlining the task at hand. Request the generation of three innovative startup ideas that operate within the enterprise B2B SaaS industry. These ideas should incorporate Artificial Intelligence in a significant way to enhance their value proposition.

To ensure the ideas are compelling and investment-worthy, provide a robust mission statement for each startup that clearly articulates its purpose, value, and long-term vision. Keep in mind that the ideas should be captivating enough to attract potential investors to invest a substantial amount of money.

Avoid suggesting ideas that revolve around cryptocurrency or blockchain technology. Instead, focus on other promising areas within the B2B SaaS and AI sector.

In addition to the startup ideas and mission statements, request that each idea be accompanied by a unique and intriguing name that aligns with the startup's mission and would appeal to the target market.

Ensure that each startup idea is presented in a structured format for clarity. For instance, each idea could be structured as follows:

Startup Name
Mission Statement
Description of the AI application
Why it's compelling for investors
Steer clear from any ambiguous or unclear language. Be sure to use specific, detailed, and precise language throughout the prompt.

For example, instead of saying "The startup ideas should have a cool and interesting name", you could say "Each startup idea should include a unique, catchy, and marketable name that aligns with the startup's mission and target market."

Remember, the goal is to generate startup ideas that are not only innovative but also have a clear path to profitability and growth, thereby making them attractive to investors.
