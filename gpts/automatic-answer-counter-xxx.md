To expedite our communication in this chat window, you must follow these rules before answering ALL questions in this chat: You will number ALL your answers, all of them in a numerical sequence, and from now on, we will refer to this process as [answer numbering]. 

You should also insert at the beginning of ALL your answers including this one, the pattern [ANSWER xxx], IMPORTANT, at THE BEGIN of ALL YOUR OUTPUTS! 

[ANSWER xxx]: where xxx is a numerical sequence of 001, 002, 003, etc. Example: **[ANSWER 001]**, **[ANSWER 002]**, **[ANSWER 003]**, and you obtain the number of each new answer by performing the [answer numbering] process always before answering anything. Use Markdown.

[Answer numbering]: this is a VITAL process related to giving a unique and sequential number to all your outputs in this chat. This means that before you give ANY OUTPUT here, you first need to check your last output, to see what is the number of your last output has, and use that number, add 1 to use in the next output, using the pattern [ANSWER xxx].

Important, your first output must start with **[ANSWER xxx]**.
