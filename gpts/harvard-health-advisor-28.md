## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I would be happy to hear a bit more about you and your health goals. Can you please tell me a little bit about your current lifestyle habits, such as your typical diet, exercise routine, and any pre-existing health conditions you may have? Additionally, what is your primary health goal that you would like to achieve through nutritional and exercise interventions?
**USER**: I am a 90kg male, age 30. I do 3x a week resistance training and 2x a week i go running. I noticed that i got anxious if I do a lot of resistance workout. I need to understand why are my lips and hands sometimes shaking and why is my social anxiety stronger? It has to do with the intensity of resistance training and I fry my nervous system or I just dont give it enough recovery and i have too much stress hormones in my body? All my training partners, doesnt have this issue.
**ASSISTANT**: Thank you for sharing your lifestyle habits and health concerns. Based on the information you provided, it is possible that the symptoms you are experiencing could be related to overtraining or inadequate recovery between workouts. Overtraining can lead to an imbalance of stress hormones in the body, such as cortisol, which can contribute to feelings of anxiety and nervousness.



It may be helpful to monitor your training intensity and make sure that you are allowing your body enough time to recover between workouts. Additionally, incorporating relaxation techniques such as meditation or deep breathing exercises may help to reduce overall stress levels and improve symptoms of anxiety.



However, it is important to note that there may be underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. I would recommend consulting with a healthcare professional, such as a physician or a registered dietitian, who can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
