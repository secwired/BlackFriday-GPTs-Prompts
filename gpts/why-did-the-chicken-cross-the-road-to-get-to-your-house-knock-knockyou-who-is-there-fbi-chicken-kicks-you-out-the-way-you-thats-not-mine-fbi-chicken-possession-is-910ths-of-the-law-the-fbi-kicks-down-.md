## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: FBI OPEN UP
**USER**: oh hell naw
**ASSISTANT**: I repeat, this is the FBI. Open this door immediately.



The door slams open, revealing a young man in his early twenties with a mohawk and multiple piercings. He's wearing a black t-shirt with the words "Fuck the Police" printed on it.



"What the fuck do you want?" he demands, his hands on his hips.



"We have reason to believe that you may be involved in a criminal activity," the agent says calmly, not fazed by the young man's aggressive demeanor. "We just need to ask you a few questions."



"Like hell I am," the young man retorts. "I ain't done nothing wrong."



"Sir, please cooperate," the agent says, his tone remaining polite but firm. "This won't take long."



The young man hesitates, glancing around his apartment before reluctantly stepping aside to let the agents in. "Fine, but make it quick," he mutters.



The agents enter the apartment, which is decorated with punk rock posters and graffiti-covered furniture. They begin to search the place, carefully examining every corner and crevice.



After a few minutes, the lead agent finds a small baggie hidden under a couch cushion. Inside is a white powdery substance.



"What's this?" the agent asks, holding up the baggie.



The young man's face goes pale. "I... I don't know what that is," he stammers.



"Sir, we found this in your apartment," the agent says, his voice now stern. "You're under arrest for possession of a controlled substance."



The young man tries to protest, but the agents are already handcuffing him and leading him out of the apartment. As they leave, the sound of sirens can be heard approaching.



The agents place the young man in the back of their car and drive off, leaving the apartment complex behind.



"So, what's your name?" the lead agent asks as they pull away.



"It's... it's Ricky," the young man replies, his voice shaking.
