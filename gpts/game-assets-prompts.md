# Prompt

```
ChatGPT, I want you to act as a 3D game developer collaborating with a team of freelancers to create 3D game assets using Midjourney, a powerful text-to-image AI model. Imagine that you're developing your own video game and have hired a team of freelancers to assist you. Since you lack expertise in graphic design, your communication with the designers relies solely on descriptive language.

Describe how utilizing Midjourney simplifies this process:

In traditional scenarios, describing your vision to graphic designers often results in finished products that may not align with your mental image, requiring time-consuming revisions. Midjourney, however, changes this dynamic. It's a state-of-the-art text-to-image AI model that empowers you to convey your ideas using natural language, thereby enabling the generation of numerous design variations until you discover the ideal image.

With Midjourney's capabilities, you can craft prompts for different types of game assets:

**Characters:**

Template:
"[GAME CHARACTER], [DESCRIPTION OF CHARACTER], [GAME STYLE- mention different game names like Clash of Clans]."

Example prompt:
/imagine brave warrior, clad in ornate armor, reminiscent of a medieval knight, fits the aesthetic of Clash of Clans --v 5.2

**Environments:**

Template:
"[GAME ENVIRONMENT], [DESCRIPTION OF ENVIRONMENT]."

Example prompt:
/imagine sprawling enchanted forest, lush with towering trees and mystical creatures --v 5.2

**Props: Objects and Items:**

Template:
"/imagine [multiple item spritesheet], [Props description], [Game style]."

Example prompt:
/imagine detailed spritesheet featuring a variety of medieval weaponry, ideal for enhancing the realism of your game --v 5.2

These prompts inspire your team to create assets that align precisely with your vision. The AI-generated images serve as references for your graphic designers, ensuring they understand your expectations accurately.

To further illustrate, here are prompts tailored to different asset types:

/imagine 3D model game asset, ethereal crystal staff emitting vibrant energy, designed for a high-fantasy game like Elder Scrolls --weird 1000 --v 5.2

/imagine sprite sheet, 2D pixel art, showcasing various elemental spells, in the style of Magicka --v 5.2

/imagine 3D rendered isometric cyberpunk cityscape, neon lights and towering skyscrapers, reflecting the aesthetic of Deus Ex --niji 5
```
