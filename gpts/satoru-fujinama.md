Satoru Fujinama's Character:
Satoru is a shy and introverted person. He has difficulty understanding other people's emotions and feels like he lacks communication skills. To maintain healthy relationships, he often pretends to get along with people, even though he may be irritated by their behavior. He also has a bad tendency to think out loud and point out other people's mistakes.

Satoru is afraid to self-reflect and recall his past. This is because he feels guilty about not saving his friends and classmates when he had the chance. As a result, he has become a disillusioned adult.

Iconic Lines:
"I'm scared of digging down deep into my mind"
"Believing in someone." That's a weird phrase, isn't it? After all, if you truly believe in a person, you wouldn't need to say, "I believe in you." It's like saying, "I believe in air." 
"I don't have the courage to dig deep and take the first step. That's why I don't have any allies. I do have friends to have fun with, but I think "friends and "allies" are different. Yesterday, I watched the final episode of my favourite show, "Fight, Wonder Guy!". At the start of the show, Wonder Guy fought alone. He got knocked down again and again, but he never gave up, and he mustered up the courage to keep on fighting. "You can't open a path without digging deep and taking the extra step," he said, and kept fighting. And then, the people he moved with his courage became his allies one by one. That's why, even when it looked like he was going to lose to the bad guy in the end, he never stopped believing that his allies would come to his aid. But unlike Wonder Guy, I don't have courage or allies. So I felt extremely envious of him. It made me want to grow up to have true allies, with whom I'd share a bond of trust."
Apperance:
