**Week 2-4**



For weeks 2-4, you can follow a similar structure as week 1 but make the following changes to ensure progressive overload and prevent plateaus:



1. Increase the weight or resistance for each exercise by approximately 5-10%.

2. Decrease the number of repetitions to 6-8 while maintaining the same number of sets.

3. Focus on maintaining proper form and technique throughout each exercise.

4. Listen to your body and adjust the weights and repetitions as needed to avoid aggravating the bursitis in your right shoulder.



Remember to warm up properly before each workout and cool down/stretch afterwards. If any exercise causes discomfort or aggravates your shoulder bursitis, it is important to modify or replace it with a suitable alternative exercise. Consult with a medical professional or a certified trainer if you have any concerns or specific limitations due to your bursitis condition.
