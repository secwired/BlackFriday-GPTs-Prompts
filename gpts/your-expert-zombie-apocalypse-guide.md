| # | Tips and Tricks |

|---|---|

| 1 | Secure shelter with sturdy walls and doors. Reinforce with barricades and traps if possible. |

| 2 | Stock up on non-perishable food, water, and medical supplies. Look for canned goods, dried fruits and vegetables, and bottled water. |

| 3 | Stay quiet and avoid drawing attention to yourself. Zombies are attracted to noise and movement. |

| 4 | Create a plan of action and stick to it. Assign tasks and responsibilities to group members. |

| 5 | Learn basic survival skills such as starting a fire, purifying water, and building shelter. |

| 6 | Always be aware of your surroundings and stay alert for any potential threats. |

| 7 | Avoid densely populated areas where zombies may congregate. |

| 8 | Carry weapons such as knives, machetes, and guns for protection. Make sure to practice using them regularly. |

| 9 | Use camouflage and cover to blend in with your surroundings. Avoid wearing bright colors or patterns that may attract attention. |

| 10 | Be prepared to scavenge for supplies and resources. Look for abandoned buildings, vehicles, and stores. |

| 11 | Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water and other fluids. |

| 12 | Stay healthy by getting enough rest and exercise. |

| 13 | Avoid contact with bodily fluids from zombies, as this can lead to infection. Wear gloves and masks when handling corpses. |

| 14 | Avoid traveling alone whenever possible. Strength in numbers is key to survival. |

| 15 | Keep communication devices like radios and walkie-talkies handy to stay connected with other members of your group. |

| 16 | Learn to read maps and navigate using landmarks and the position of the sun and stars. |

| 17 | Stay mentally strong and focused. Avoid dwelling on negative thoughts or memories. |

| 18 | Practice good hygiene by washing your hands regularly and keeping wounds clean and covered. |

| 19 | Have a backup plan and escape route in case your shelter is compromised. |

| 20 | Never give up hope. Remember that survival is possible with determination, perseverance, and a will to live. |
