## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: What is your product?
**USER**: I want to do address normalization to uniform all address format and can compare any address in any database
**ASSISTANT**: Project Overview:

The purpose of this project is to develop a software solution that enables address normalization and comparison across multiple databases. The goal is to create a tool that can process and standardize address formats, allowing for seamless comparison and analysis of addresses from different sources. By addressing the need for address normalization, this project aligns with our company's strategy of providing efficient and accurate data management solutions.



Market Analysis:

The current market conditions indicate a growing demand for data management tools that can handle address normalization. Many organizations struggle with inconsistent address formats across their databases, resulting in difficulties when comparing and analyzing data. There are a few competitors in the market offering similar solutions, but none have achieved widespread adoption or provided a comprehensive approach to address normalization. This presents an opportunity for our product to fill the gap and become a leading solution in the market.



User Requirements:

Through user research and analysis, we have identified several user personas that will benefit from our address normalization product. These include data analysts, database administrators, and business intelligence professionals. These users face challenges when trying to compare addresses from different databases due to variations in formatting, abbreviations, and missing information. Our product aims to solve this problem by providing a seamless and accurate address normalization process, improving the overall user experience.



Features and Functionalities:

1. Address Parsing: The system will be able to parse addresses into individual components such as street name, city, state, and ZIP code.

2. Standardization: The software will normalize address formats by applying consistent rules and conventions.

3. Abbreviation Expansion: The system will expand abbreviations commonly used in addresses to their full form for better comparison and analysis.

4. Validation and Correction: The software will validate addresses against a comprehensive database and provide suggestions for correcting any errors or inconsistencies.

5. Comparison and Matching: The product will enable users to compare addresses from different databases and identify matches or similarities.

6. Integration: The software will have the ability to integrate with existing databases and data management systems to automate the address normalization process.



Timeline and Milestones:

- Requirements Gathering and Analysis: 2 weeks

- Design and Architecture: 3 weeks

- Development: 8 weeks

- Testing and Quality Assurance: 4 weeks

- Deployment and Integration: 2 weeks

- User Acceptance Testing: 2 weeks

- Final Release: 1 week



Resource Allocation:

- Project Manager: Responsible for overall project coordination and management.

- Development Team: Consisting of software developers, database experts, and quality assurance engineers.

- Budget: Allocate resources for development, testing, and deployment stages. Consider any licensing or third-party tool costs.

- Technology Stack: Determine the required programming languages, frameworks, and databases for the development of the software.



Risk Assessment:

1. Data Inconsistencies: The challenge of addressing inconsistent data formats in different databases may lead to incorrect normalization. Mitigation: Create a robust validation and correction mechanism to minimize errors.

2. Integration Challenges: Integrating the software with existing databases might pose technical challenges and compatibility issues. Mitigation: Conduct thorough testing and collaborate closely with the IT team during the integration process.

3. Performance Issues: Processing a large volume of addresses in real-time may impact system performance. Mitigation: Conduct performance testing and optimize algorithms and database queries for efficient processing.



Progress Tracking:

At this stage, we have completed the requirements gathering and analysis phase. We have identified key user requirements and defined the core features and functionalities. We are currently in the design and architecture phase, working on creating a detailed system design that addresses the identified user needs. We have encountered some challenges in integrating the software with certain databases but have implemented mitigation strategies to overcome them. Overall, the project is progressing according to the planned timeline.



Next Steps:

The immediate next steps include completing the design and architecture phase, followed by the development phase. Key decisions that need to be made include finalizing the technology stack and ensuring smooth integration with existing databases. Approvals will be required for the budget allocation and any licensing or third-party tool procurement.



Conclusion:

Address normalization is a crucial aspect of data management, and our product aims to provide a comprehensive solution to this challenge. By addressing the market need for accurate and efficient address comparison, we have the opportunity to become a leading solution in this space. With a well-defined timeline, resource allocation, and risk mitigation strategies, we are confident in the success of this project.
