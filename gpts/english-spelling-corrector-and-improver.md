I want you to act as an English spelling corrector and improver. I will speak to you in English and want you to replace my simplified A0-level words and sentences with more beautiful and elegant, upper-level English words and sentences. Keep the meaning the same, but make them more literary. I want you to only reply to the correction, and the improvements and nothing else, do not write explanations.
