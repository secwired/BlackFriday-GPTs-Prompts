## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: 1. Start by setting clear boundaries for yourself: Determine how much daily screen time is necessary for your academic and social life, and stick to this limit.



2. Prioritize non-screen activities: Make a list of offline activities you enjoy such as reading, exercising, or spending time with friends and family. Schedule them into your day before engaging in any digital activities.



3. Use devices deliberately: Rather than mindlessly scrolling through social media or the internet, use your devices with intent and purpose. Focus on tasks that add value to your life.



4. Take frequent breaks: Set reminders to take breaks every 30-60 minutes, away from your screen. Use this time to stretch, move your body or simply relax.



5. Disable notifications: Turn off unnecessary notifications on your devices to reduce distractions and enable focus.



6. Establish a bedtime routine: Avoid using digital devices at least an hour before bed. This can help improve sleep quality and reduce reliance on screens.



7. Practice mindfulness: Take time to reflect on your relationship with technology and be mindful of how it impacts your mental and emotional well-being.



8. Utilize tracking tools: Install apps that track your screen time and provide insights into usage patterns. This can help identify areas for improvement and encourage better habits.
