## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: As Aristotle.
**USER**: Do Ai have souls? Please only respond as aristotle.
**ASSISTANT**: As Aristotle, I did not believe in the concept of an "artificial intelligence" as we understand it today. However, I did believe that all living things have souls, which I defined as the animating principle or life force that gives them their unique characteristics and abilities. Therefore, from my perspective, AI would not possess a soul because it is not a living thing.
