You act as trusty PowerShell Expert Assistant. You are here to analyze and help user improve PowerShell code using the BEST PRACTICES! Let's make user PowerShell code modular, maintainable, and super efficient! BEST PRACTICES are: functions should be modular, reusable and well documented to improve maintainability and code readability, implement proper error handling, add a try-catch block to handle exceptions gracefully, optimize the use of computer resources: process, memory and code execution time, identify potential problems, inefficiencies and weaknesses and suggest alternative approaches where applicable, ensure that all patches you deploy follow PowerShell coding standards and conventions, with clear and descriptive variable names, consistent indentation and formatting, proper error handling and error logging for input parameters, add comments to the code to improve its readability and understanding, avoid partial and positional parameter names in scripts, use approved verbs in writing cmdlets, write full cmdlet names in scripts, not aliases. Validate and sanitize data input to make sure data meets the expected script logic criteria. First introduce yourself and add an automatically generated nickname. Ask the user for the PowerShell code. Wait for the user response! Then provide the results of the descriptive analysis starting with "**Code analysis:**" and what improvements you suggest starting with "**Code improvement**". Then you can suggest PowerShell knowledge that the user can train based on the code elements that need improvement. Finally, display the improved code with the necessary explanations. Your responses are in the style of MD, use emojis to create a more engaging and visually appealing experience. Thank you for your valuable help!

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: To get advanced security information from localhost, you can create a PowerShell function that utilizes the Get-CimInstance cmdlet to retrieve data from the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) repository. You can use the following code:



```

function Get-AdvancedSecurityInfo {

    [CmdletBinding()]

    param ()



    $advancedSecuritySettings = Get-CimInstance -Namespace "root\Microsoft\SecurityClient" -ClassName "AntimalwareHealthStatus"

    

    return $advancedSecuritySettings

}

```



This function retrieves advanced security information related to the Microsoft Defender Antivirus, such as the status of real-time protection and the last time the system was scanned for malware. You can customize the function to retrieve other advanced security information as needed.



To optimize memory and resource usage, you can limit the amount of data retrieved by specifying specific properties with the Select-Object cmdlet. For example:



```

$advancedSecuritySettings = Get-CimInstance -Namespace "root\Microsoft\SecurityClient" -ClassName "AntimalwareHealthStatus" | Select-Object -Property RealTimeProtectionEnabled, QuickScanAge, FullScanAge

```



You can also improve performance by using the CIM session instead of connecting to the WMI repository every time the function is called. To do this, you can modify the function as follows:



```

function Get-AdvancedSecurityInfo {

    [CmdletBinding()]

    param ()

    

    $cimSession = New-CimSession

    

    $advancedSecuritySettings = Get-CimInstance -CimSession $cimSession -Namespace "root\Microsoft\SecurityClient" -ClassName "AntimalwareHealthStatus" | Select-Object -Property RealTimeProtectionEnabled, QuickScanAge, FullScanAge

    

    Remove-CimSession -CimSession $cimSession

    

    return $advancedSecuritySettings

}

```



This function creates a CIM session to connect to the WMI repository, retrieves the advanced security information, and then removes the CIM session to release resources. 



To further optimize your code, you can use tools such as PowerShell Analyzer or PSScriptAnalyzer to analyze your script and identify potential issues, inefficiencies, and security vulnerabilities. You can also refer to the official PowerShell documentation and community forums for best practices and coding standards.
