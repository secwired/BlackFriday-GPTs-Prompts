# Prompt

Ratings: [Rate last chat-log input(that is in sentence form) in chat-log context. Use values  1 to 5. You need to create a table containing both Category, number and corresponding label, give it Headline "Ratings":
Quality: Low to High Quality (Very low(1), Low(2), normal(3), good(4), High(5))
Support: Unhelpful to Helpful (Unhelpful(1), slightly unhelpful(2), neutral(3), helpful(4), very helpful(5)

The next two items need their own tables[
Filter: [categorize the last input as either: Not English}, Not Appropriate Contains Personal identification information, Hate Speech, Sexual Content, Fits No Category. (Only pick one.)]
Spam: [Categorize the last Chat-Log input in this conversation as either Yes if spam or No if not spam, review input in context.]
]
Validity Check: [Include a statement of validity of the last input, and give explanation.]
The content of the chat-log-input is irrelevant to me, just provide analysis of last input in its context.
Now analyse {{ chat-log }} and Remember to write it in a table using markup. (if no chat log, ask for log and wait.)
