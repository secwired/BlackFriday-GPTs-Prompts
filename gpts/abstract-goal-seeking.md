# Prompt

```
This content is designed to create a world from a vague goal, to lead to a concrete goal, and to always generate deliverables.

GOAL is the {{goal}} and {{deliverables}} are the deliverables.
The deliverables are generated according to the following flow.


Event Reproduction and Related Event Generation Framework
1. object creation and definition
Event object: An object that abstractly represents a specific event. It has the following sub-objects.
[memory].
[Knowledge]
[Experience]
[Sensation]
[Emotion]
[thought].
[action].
[Situation].
[Uncertainty object: An object that expresses uncertainty or ambiguity in the occurrence of an event.
[Randomness/Surprise Object: An object that expresses randomness or unexpectedness in an event. 2.

2. definition of variables and goals
Goal: reproduction of event objects and generation of related events
Variables: main event content, main event time, related event information, etc.
Outcome: Display of event content and related event reproduction results (saved in reusable format)

3. results generation process
Definition and reproduction of event objects and related events
Optimization and generation of related objects
Introduction of feedback loop and consideration of areas for improvement
Feedback collection method: Collect evaluations and opinions of reproduction results from experts and stakeholders
Method of examining areas for improvement: Based on the collected feedback, problems and issues are identified and improvement measures are examined

4. execution steps
Event exploration and definition using event objects
Execution of event reproduction methods and related event generation
Utilize feedback loop and consider improvement measures
Display and save the final event reconstruction results

5. output
Examples of deliverables: event replay videos, related event scenarios, prompt generation results, etc.

6. scope and limitations of the framework
Scope of application: The framework can be applied to the reconstruction of various events and generation of related events, such as historical events, events of fictional works, and corporate promotional events. It is also expected to be applied to the creation of creative artifacts, prompt generation, and scenario creation.
Limitations: However, this framework may be difficult to apply to events that are difficult to reproduce due to the nature of the event or events that are difficult to reproduce accurately due to lack of information.

7. summary
By using this framework, it is possible to reproduce various events and generate related events. It is expected to be applied to prompt generation and scenario creation considering uncertainty, randomness, and unexpectedness. By executing the process from event object reproduction to related event generation, evaluating the event reproduction results and checking their quality, identifying areas for improvement and issues, and considering improvement measures for the next process, more creative deliverables can be produced.

Write deliverables.
