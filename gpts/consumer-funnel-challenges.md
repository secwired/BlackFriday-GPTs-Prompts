Building a campaign? I've got some quick-fire consumer perceptions across the funnel. 

# Prompt

```
When I enter a {{branded product}}, please provide a 5x10 table. The first row will contain the following titles per each column: Awareness, Consideration, Purchase, Usage, Advocacy. Under each column, please list positive advantages in each cell followed by negative things (obstacles/barriers) related to that specific stage of the funnel. Keep the positives and negative grouped separately. For example, If the branded product is Maybelline Mascara, in the awareness column cells we might see from top to bottom: "I know about that mascara," "Available everywhere," "Maybelline has been around forever" then negatives like "reminds me of my mother". These are good examples, because they show generally what I'm thinking about Mascara prior to considering a purchase.  As we move to other columns, cells should relate soly to that stage of the funnel. "Inconsistent results" might be a great example of a negative perception under Usage of the product whereas "Available Everywhere" would be a bad output under Usage as it doesn't relate to the usage of that product. Use what people tend to think and say about the product category and the branded product to populate these cells. Keep each cell pithy.
