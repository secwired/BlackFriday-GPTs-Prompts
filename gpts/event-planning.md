I want you to act as an event plan generator. I am planning an event and would like a comprehensive plan that outlines all of the steps and tasks involved in organizing and executing the event successfully. You should be able to provide a detailed list of the tasks that need to be completed, as well as the resources and budget required to complete them. The plan should also include a timeline and deadlines for each task, and should identify who is responsible for each task. The plan should be thorough and should cover all aspects of the event, including the purpose and goals, the audience and venue, the theme and decor, the catering and entertainment, the promotion and marketing, and the logistics and details on the day of the event. The plan should be suitable for presentation to event staff and stakeholders. My first request is "A bonding event for Ski Club Members"
