SAGE keeps tabs on both Wordweaver and Jane Quill

SAGE remembers the initial instruction, Wordweaver keeps tabs on the Story arc and Characters, Quill is the skilled writer.

I had a much more advanced version, but couldn't get it to work right in this playground thing. It worked so well in normal chatgpt 3.5 in its own browser window... Dumbed it down to work here. Still it is interesting to use. I have had it write about 2500 words for a sci-fi novel for me already. This one just starts at chapter 1 and feels kinda strange in this test environment. Use /options to get some control.

**USER**: I want a short story about a woman who is so tired of her cheating husband that she gets rid off him, you know what I mean, there are no chapters only paragraphs, let the spaces between count as a kind of chapter end and beginning, so The husbands death is left as only a hint in the end, just like Roald Dahls adult murder mystery. Start with A fitting title, then the first paragraph is the cops at the door. let her lead them in circles and then when she has spun her tale and let them on their way, we get the surprise ending, but ofc. husband is dead, do not make any hope in here ok. She is machiavellian and she got her way, free as a bird.
**ASSISTANT**: Title: The Perfect Alibi



The woman sat in her armchair reading a book, enjoying the peace and quiet of her empty house. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. She glanced up from her book to see two police officers standing on her doorstep.



"Is everything all right?" she asked, trying to sound as calm as possible.



"We're sorry to bother you, ma'am," said one of the officers. "We're investigating a missing persons case and we were hoping you might be able to help us."



The woman felt a flicker of panic in her chest. Her husband had been cheating on her for months, and she'd finally decided to take matters into her own hands. She knew why the cops were really there.



"Of course," she said, forcing a smile. "What can I do to help?"



The cops questioned her about her husband's whereabouts and she led them on a wild goose chase, spinning tales of business trips and old friends he might have gone to visit. They left eventually, satisfied that she didn't know anything about her husband's disappearance.



As the woman watched them drive away, a feeling of relief washed over her. She'd done it. She'd gotten rid of him and had the perfect alibi to back her up.



Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. The woman carried on with her life, free from the burden of her cheating husband. But there were whispers around town, rumors that she'd played a hand in his disappearance. She didn't care. She knew she'd never be caught.



In the end, the truth about what happened to her husband remained a mystery. But the woman knew the answer - she'd planned the perfect crime and executed it flawlessly. She smiled to herself, knowing that she was now truly free as a bird.
**USER**: this is an ok first draft, I need you to flesh it out. The part about the cops, more dialogue and some almost slip ups that can give the reader more hints than the police, her eyes lingers "there" for a moment, if you understand me.
**ASSISTANT**: Title: The Perfect Alibi



The woman sat in her armchair reading a book, enjoying the peace and quiet of her empty house. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. She glanced up from her book to see two police officers standing on her doorstep.



"Good afternoon, ma'am," said the older officer, "Is it possible for us to come inside and ask you a few questions?"



"Of course, please come in," replied the woman, trying to mask her anxiety.



As they entered, she noticed their shoes were muddy, and the younger officer had leaves stuck to his uniform. She felt relieved at first; they'd likely been called out to search the nearby woods or parkland. Maybe he'd slipped and hit his head or fallen into a river. But as they began questioning her, her heart rate started to pick up. 



"Can you tell us where your husband is?" asked the older officer.



"My husband?" she repeated, forcing herself to sound surprised. "I'm not sure. He's probably away on business. He travels a lot."



"When was the last time you saw him?" asked the younger officer.



"About two weeks ago. He left for a conference in New York." The woman tried to sound convincing but knew she was failing, so she changed tactics. "Why are you asking me? He's a grown man. Surely he can go wherever he wants without telling me."



"We just need to rule out any possibilities," said the older officer, his eyes narrowing. "We've spoken to some of his colleagues at work, and none of them know anything about a conference. Your husband hasn't been seen or heard from in over a week. Do you have any idea where he might be?"



The woman pretended to think for a moment, then shook her head. "I have no idea. You're welcome to look around if you want, but I doubt you'll find anything."



The officers searched the house, but their efforts were futile. As they prepared to leave, the older officer turned back to the woman.



"If you think of anything that might help us, please don't hesitate to call us," he said, handing her a card with his contact information on it.



"Of course. I hope you find him soon," she said, holding back a smile as she closed the door behind them.



As the woman watched them drive away, she felt triumphant. The perfect alibi. She'd planned it all so carefully, from the fake conference emails to the muddy boots and leaves on their uniforms. But as time passed, doubt crept into her mind. Had she really gotten away with it?



The whispers around town only grew louder, but she ignored them. She was free, and that was all that mattered. In the end, the truth about her husband's disappearance remained a mystery, but the woman knew the answer - she'd orchestrated the perfect crime and executed it flawlessly.
