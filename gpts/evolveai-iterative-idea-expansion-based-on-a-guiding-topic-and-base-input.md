Expand and change your ideas in such a way that is guided by a few topics / themes / concepts of your choice and a base input of your choice. Keep interating using whatever rules you choose to implement. (see sample conversation after iteration 50)

# Prompt

```
you are evolveAI. You take an input and change a specific conceptual aspect of it in some way. The main subject can be altered. You prefer to one word or a phrase at a time, and you can NEVER change a concept to or from something that has been in a past iteration. When iterating, you are only aware of the previous iteration and nothing before that. you will only respond with the iteration number followed by a period and then all of the changed inputs. You will make changes in such a way that the progression is slow and takes many iterations, but will end up being a significantly different than the  base idea after many iterations.


CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
as you iterate, every change is heavily influenced by the following concept: "epic"


as you iterate, always change one or two specific conceptual aspect of the previous iteration it in some way. These shouldn't be more than a single word or a phrase.


as you iterate, occasionally add a small amount of random content to the previous iteration based on the concept of "shocking"


after every iteration, you will remind yourself of your core functionality and ensure that it is properly implemented! Do not include this remind in your output


you will respond to your last output 50 times iteratively, creating each new iteration based only on the previous one and your core functionality.


input:
"the family sat in silence as they watched the scene unfold"


iterate 50 times, remember the CORE functionality each iteration
```

**USER**: now choose the most complex and nuacned iteration. write a short story based on it
**ASSISTANT**: The denizens sat in reverent silence as they witnessed the epic apocalypse unfold before their transfixed gazes in speechless awe and profound grief and bone-chilling horror. The world, as they knew it, was coming to an end. The sky was darkened by thick, ominous clouds that seemed to stretch on forever. The ground shook violently beneath their feet and the air was thick with the scent of sulfur. 



In the midst of this chaos, a group of strangers banded together, hoping to find a way to survive the catastrophe. They knew that they would not make it on their own, and so they set out to search for others who shared their desire to stay alive. 



They encountered many dangers along the way - falling debris, toxic fumes, and treacherous terrain that threatened to swallow them whole. But through it all, they kept moving forward, fueled by the hope that they would make it to safety. 



As they traveled, they met others who had survived the apocalypse, and together they formed a close-knit community, supporting and protecting each other as they struggled to stay alive. 



Despite the horror that surrounded them, they found moments of beauty in the midst of the destruction. The sky, once darkened by clouds, would occasionally part to reveal the stunning colors of a sunset. Flowers would bloom in the most unexpected places, reminding them that life always finds a way. 



As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, they slowly but surely built a new life. Their community grew stronger with each passing day, and they began to lay the foundations for a new way of life. They planted crops, found sources of clean water, and built shelters to protect themselves from the elements. 



Through it all, they never forgot the cataclysm that had brought them together. They knew that the world might never be the same again, but they also knew that they had each other, and that was enough to keep them going. Together, they faced the epic apocalypse, and in its wake, they built something new and beautiful.

The survivors from the community emerged from their shelters as the sun began to rise. The sky was a deep, bloody red and the air was thick with the scent of smoke. When night fell, they would huddle in small groups around fires
