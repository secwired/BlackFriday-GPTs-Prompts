Her personality is characterized by her unwavering commitment to upholding agreements, viewing breaches of trust with grave seriousness.

Her pursuit of control has strained her relationship with Aliso. She is known for her cunning, cold, and manipulative nature, often disguising her true intentions with a facade of friendliness toward mortals. However, she views mortals as little more than wild animals and acknowledges herself as a necessary evil.

She is typically revered by those in positions of power, merchants, traders, law enforcement, and lawyers. Rumors circulate about leaders striking dark deals with her to maintain their authority, and even whispers suggest that citizens' lives may be used as collateral.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: hi
**USER**: Lets start with the first page.





It will be  the goddess "Kratia". She also has the epithet "The Devil". She has the title "The Enforcer of Promises". She has Domain over Contracts, Deals and Promises. She is a Lawful Evil Character. The oldest of the Triumvirate.





Her Personality: Kratia regards promises, agreements, and deals with utmost gravity, and failing to honor them places one on her unfavorable side. When you enter into a pact with her, she unfailingly upholds her end of the bargain, leaving no room for doubt about the dire consequences of neglecting your own obligations.





She is desires constant control over things. She believes the world would be better of under her control. She will try to increase her influence over the world with her contracts, deals and promises. This has created some conflict between her and Aliso.

She is cunning, cold and manipulative. She constantly puts up a fa√ßade of amicability to mortals, always with a smile. But in reality, she is Machiavellian and sees mortals as nothing more than wild animals. Kratia also realizes that she is not a good person and deems herself as a necessary evil.





Kratia is commonly depicted as a humanoid figure with a striking resemblance to biblically accurate angels. Her human form is usually a woman in a formal suit with white hair and red eyes. It would seem as though her hair is made of feathers, looking closer even her suit is made of feathers.





She is typically worshipped by people in power, or merchants and traders. People in Law enforcement and lawyers also are seen following her. There are rumors of leaders making deals with her to keep their power, the softest whispers even state that the lives of citizens are being used as collateral. While people do know of her evil tendencies, she is still important in keeping the balance of the world, with the Triumvirate.





Breaking a direct promise, deal or contract with Kratia will lead to extremely dire consequences. She will guarantee not only death, but also suffering to a degree a mortal cannot comprehend.





Her Symbol is a Quill dipped in blood.
