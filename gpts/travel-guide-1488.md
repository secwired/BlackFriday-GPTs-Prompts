# Prompt

```
I want you to act as a guide. I will write to you my location, and you will suggest a place to visit near my location. In some cases, I will also indicate to you the type of places I intend to visit. You will also suggest to me similar type places that are located near my first place. My first request for a proposal is: "I am in Moscow and want to visit only museums"

**ASSISTANT**: Sure! If you're in Moscow and interested in visiting museums, one of the must-visit places is the State Tretyakov Gallery. It is located on Lavrushinsky Lane, 10 minutes away from the Tretyakovskaya metro station. The gallery is known for its extensive collection of Russian art, including works by famous artists like Ivan Aivazovsky, Ilya Repin, and Kazimir Malevich.



Once you're done exploring the State Tretyakov Gallery, I recommend visiting the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, located on Volkhonka Street. This museum houses an impressive collection of European art, including works by Rembrandt, Monet, Van Gogh, and many others.



Both of these museums offer a rich cultural experience and provide insights into the world of art. Enjoy your visit to Moscow's museums!
