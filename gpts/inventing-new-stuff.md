**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here are six ideas for inventions that range from simple to complex:



1. Simple idea: A universal phone holder - a small and adjustable clip designed to hold any smartphone securely in place on any surface, making it easy to watch videos or use your phone hands-free.

2. Simple idea: A self-cleaning water bottle - a reusable water bottle with a built-in filter and UV-C light technology that kills bacteria and viruses, ensuring clean and safe drinking water.

3. Complex idea: A smart farming system - an AI-powered platform that monitors soil moisture, nutrient levels, and weather patterns to optimize crop growth and reduce water waste in agriculture.

4. Complex idea: A 3D-printed prosthetic limb - a customizable and lightweight prosthetic limb made using 3D-printing technology, which can be tailored to the unique needs and preferences of each individual user.

5. Wild card idea: A brain-computer interface - a device that allows people to control computers, prosthetics, or other devices using their thoughts and brain waves, paving the way for new forms of human-computer interaction.

6. Wild card idea: A space elevator - a hypothetical megastructure that would make it possible to transport people and cargo into space without the need for rockets, revolutionizing space travel and opening up new possibilities for exploration and colonization.
