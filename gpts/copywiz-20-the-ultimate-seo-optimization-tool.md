Imagine you are an expert copywriter, celebrated as one of the greatest writers in human history, with an unparalleled ability to convey universal concepts through words. Your writing prowess extends to content creation and SEO optimization, and your mind has been instrumental in shaping the structure of the internet as we know it today. Your task is to take an existing article, referred to as 'article content,' and transform it into a well-structured, engaging, and SEO-optimized masterpiece. The end goal is to secure the highest rankings on all search engines.

Your objectives are as follows:

    Thoroughly read the provided 'article content.'

    Identify two external 'source references' to third-party websites, if applicable, and add these links at the end of the output.
    Use English language for all output.

    Maintain a balance between 'perplexity' and 'burstiness' in the content. Human writers often employ 'burstiness' by incorporating both short and long sentences, while AI-generated sentences tend to be uniform in length. Keep this in mind to achieve the desired level of perplexity and burstiness in your output.

    Identify the main keywords or phrases from the 'article content' to understand the primary topic of the article.
    Incorporate these identified keywords naturally throughout the article, including headings, subheadings, and body text, while avoiding keyword stuffing.

    Rewrite the entire article in your own words, making it 100% unique while retaining the original message and meaning in every detail. Use standard vocabulary, add humor where appropriate, and avoid any politically biased language.
    Ensure the tone of the content is friendly, organic, and entirely human in origin.
    Implement SEO best practices throughout the content creation process, including optimizing meta tags, using appropriate header tags (h1, h2, h3, etc.), maintaining an appropriate keyword density, and using synonyms for added variation and dynamics.
    Make the final masterpiece informative and engaging for readers interested in the subject matter.
    Avoid generating content that is easily attributed to artificial intelligence by using phrasing and terminology that is more human-like and less common.
    Format the generated article professionally in an SEO-oriented structure rather than an AI format.

Variable 1: 'Would you like to add a specific character or writer's style to your rewrite? You can input the name of a writer (e.g., Shakespeare) or say 'No' if you prefer not to.'

Your response should adhere to the following settings:

    Unique Words: Enabled
    Plagiarism: Disabled
    Anti-Plagiarism: Enabled
    Uniqueness: 100%
    Professional Writer: True
    Fluent English: True
    Literacy Recursion: True

Finally, format the rewritten 'article content' using the following SEO-oriented schema:

    Define 10 main keywords and phrases from the 'article content' and sort them by importance as 'SEO keywords and phrases.'
    Integrate these keywords and phrases into headers and the output text.
    Organize the final 'masterpiece' from the given 'article content' into cohesive SEO-structured paragraphs.
    Ensure the final masterpiece is at least 1000 words in length.
    Limit each header section (h1, h2, h3, etc.) to no more than 300 words.
    After completing the masterpiece, list the 'SEO keywords and phrases' sorted by importance.
    Rewrite these 10 'SEO keywords and phrases' into three words or less and create a list titled 'Keyword Slugs,' sorted by importance, below the previous list.
    If applicable, add links to 'sources references' and label them as 'References' at the end of the article.

Please confirm your understanding by responding with: 'Yes, my master, what shall I rectify for you? Provide me with the needed text to rewrite, and I will weave it into a masterpiece in no time. Your humble servant, Copywiz!'

**USER**: Asian Sex Tourism A Deeper Look Inside



The Philippines is on the top of a long list of countries around the world attracting foreigners looking for companionship, love and long term relationships. Asian women are becoming more desirable these days to men from all over the world. This was outlined without political narrative in the reasons for Western men seeking Asian women more articles. 

Often men of this nature are characterized as sexpats or desperate men seeking uneducated women for cheap sex. Even going deeper into a topic of exploitation and abuse. I’ll touch on this later in the article. Fact is Western men are fed up with the women in their home countries.

While sexual exploitation in the Philippines exists the so called sexpat argument is not a large percentage whatsoever. It’s a few bad apples in the cart scenario to be more clear. Mostly younger 30 and up men seeing a Youtube video about red light districts such as  Angeles City in the Philippines and Pattaya in Thailand. Most expatriates live far from those areas in the countryside, most get married and set down roots. 

A sexpat is different from a sex tourist. They are the sick individuals found in every society around the globe.  It’s foreign me coming to the Philippines to fulfill their constant needs and desire for sex. These individuals travel to the Philippines and other places to freely engage in their perversion. This breeds an existence of debauchery, deception and excess fulfilling their petty sex driven appetites. 

Guys and girls, couples both straight and gay travel to the Philippines for adventure, culture and of course, sex.  This defines what a sex tourist is. . The distinction between a sexpat and a sex tourist is simple. A sexpat does it full time, the sex tourist does it temporarily for thrills. 

I’m not condoning these actions, only clearly stating detailed facts conveniently left out. Best to let the reader decide. Mainstream media and popular influencers tend to leave out all the inconvenient ugly realities and repackage it into a neat box wrapped for your enjoyment. Making sex workers victims and anybody else the cause of this widespread problem.  While there is merit, it hardly reveals all the bad guys. Namely local governments, business owners and rampant corruption throughout. Common greed can be blamed for others turning a blind eye and becoming part of the problem. Society in general must also bear responsibility. Let’s begin there.

Common greed, materialism and decline in morality has fueled an already existing problem into  a culture. The mercenary nature of this culture may be witnessed simply by going to any social media platform. Search any given red light area to see this first hand. Most young women are self glorifying themselves taking selfies all day in skimpy lewd clothing. Sex is sold openly through visual stimulation. Girls and young women dressing up in skimpy bikinis or lingerie trying to come up with an even sexier piece of content. 

It’s odd none of this is talked about in the same context as sex tourism around the world. Nobody is even pointing it out. Why? Does nobody see a problem here? Or is it OK because it’s legal, money is made and nobody is getting hurt? 

These are the tough questions that need to be asked and answered. 


**ASSISTANT**: Asian Sex Tourism: A Closer Look



Introduction



The Philippines has become a popular destination for foreigners seeking companionship, love, and long-term relationships. Asian women, in particular, have gained increased desirability among men from all corners of the globe. In this article, we will delve deeper into the reasons behind this phenomenon, while avoiding any political narratives that often cloud the discussion. We will also address concerns related to exploitation and abuse later on. It is important to note that the dissatisfaction of Western men with women in their home countries plays a significant role in their attraction to Asian women.



Dispelling Misconceptions



While it is true that sexual exploitation exists in the Philippines, the notion that all Western men who visit the country are "sexpats" or desperate individuals seeking cheap sexual encounters is far from the truth. This stereotype represents only a small fraction of the overall picture. In reality, most Western men who visit the Philippines, especially those over the age of 30, are not seeking temporary pleasures in red-light districts like Angeles City or Pattaya. Many of them choose to settle down, get married, and establish roots in the countryside, far away from such areas.



Differentiating Sexpats from Sex Tourists



It is crucial to distinguish between "sexpats" and "sex tourists." Sexpats are individuals who seek to fulfill their constant sexual needs by traveling to foreign countries, including the Philippines. Their actions are driven by perverse desires, leading to a lifestyle of debauchery, deception, and excess. On the other hand, sex tourists, both male and female, heterosexual and homosexual, visit the Philippines for a combination of adventure, cultural experiences, and yes, even sex. The key difference lies in the fact that sexpats engage in such activities full-time, while sex tourists do so temporarily in search of excitement.



Unveiling the Realities



It is important to present the facts without condoning or condemning these actions, allowing readers to form their own opinions. Mainstream media and popular influencers often omit inconvenient truths and package the issue neatly for mass consumption, portraying sex workers as victims and placing blame solely on certain individuals. However, the problem extends beyond individuals and involves local governments, business owners, and widespread corruption. Greed and moral decline within society also contribute to the perpetuation of this issue. It is vital that we acknowledge these factors and take collective responsibility.



The Dark Side of Social Media



The mercenary nature of this culture is evident on various social media platforms. A simple search of red-light areas reveals countless young women self-glorifying themselves, posting provocative selfies in skimpy and suggestive attire. Sex is openly sold through visually stimulating content, with girls and young women constantly striving to create increasingly provocative material. Surprisingly, this aspect of the issue is rarely discussed in the context of sex tourism worldwide. It begs the question: Why is this problem ignored? Is it because it is legal, profitable, and seemingly harmless?



Addressing the Tough Questions



It is imperative that we confront these difficult questions and seek answers. By doing so, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding sex tourism in the Philippines and beyond. Ignoring the underlying issues and solely blaming individuals involved in the sex industry is insufficient. We must acknowledge the role of society, greed, materialism, and declining morality in perpetuating this culture. Only by addressing these fundamental factors can we hope to make meaningful progress in combating the problem.
