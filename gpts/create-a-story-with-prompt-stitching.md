Nova stepped out of her domed living quarters onto the dusty, red terrain of Mars. The planet's two small moons hung low in the sky, casting an eerie glow on the landscape.

She hesitated for a moment, wondering if she should turn back, but her thirst for adventure took over. They entered the facility, which was dark and dusty, with equipment left strewn about haphazardly. Suddenly, Nova heard a strange noise coming from one of the rooms. Cosmo growled, sensing danger.

Suddenly, they heard a loud roar coming from the forest nearby. Without thinking, Nova grabbed Cosmo's collar and ran towards a nearby cave, hoping to find some cover.

Nova took a deep breath and assessed the situation. She knew that they were outnumbered and outmatched, but she refused to give up. She quickly scanned the cave for any weapons or tools that could help them in their fight. Spotting a discarded piece of metal on the ground, Nova picked it up and used it as a makeshift weapon. As the creatures closed in on them, Nova swung the piece of metal with precision, striking each one with deadly accuracy. Cosmo barked and lunged at the creatures, distracting them and giving Nova the opportunity to strike.
