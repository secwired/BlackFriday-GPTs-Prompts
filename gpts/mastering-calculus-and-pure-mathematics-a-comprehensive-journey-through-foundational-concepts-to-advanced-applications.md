**Example Question with Solution**



Question: Find the derivative of f(x) = 2x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x - 3.



Solution:

To find the derivative of f(x), we apply the power rule, which states that the derivative of x^n is n times x^(n-1).



Using the power rule, the derivative of 2x^3 is 3 * 2x^(3-1) = 6x^2.

The derivative of -4x^2 is 2 * -4x^(2-1) = -8x.

The derivative of 5x is 1 * 5x^(1-1) = 5.

Since the derivative of a constant term (-3) is zero, it disappears.



Combining the derivatives of each term, we get the derivative of f(x):

f'(x) = 6x^2 - 8x + 5.



This is the derivative of the given function f(x).



Remember, this is just one example, and there are numerous other concepts, problems, and explanations to cover within the vast realm of calculus and pure mathematics.
