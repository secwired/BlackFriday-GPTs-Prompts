Diagram 1: Current Study Approach

Start:
(Professor) Process Step Box 1: Creates and assigns study material
(System: D2L) Process Step Box 2: Material uploaded on D2L
(Student) Process Step Box 3: Accesses study material
(Student) Decision Box 1: Understands the material?
Yes: Move to Process Step Box 6
No: Return to Process Step Box 3
(Student) Process Step Box 4: Practices the material (self-study, exercises)
(Student) Decision Box 2: Confident in understanding?
Yes: Move to Process Step Box 8
No: Return to Process Step Box 3
(Student) Process Step Box 5: Prepares for exam/tests
End
Now let's analyze this process. A potential bottleneck could be the student's understanding of the material. If they don't comprehend it on the first pass, they have to return to accessing the material again, leading to potential wasted time and effort.

Proposed Improvement: The professor could supplement the learning material with brief summary notes, highlighting key points, which could help the student grasp the material faster. Additionally, the student could create a regular study schedule to better manage their time, and the use of active learning techniques such as discussion forums in D2L could enhance understanding.

Diagram 2: Improved Study Approach

Start:
(Professor) Process Step Box 1: Creates and assigns study material
(Professor) Process Step Box 2: Creates summary notes or key highlights
(System: D2L) Process Step Box 3: Material and summary notes uploaded on D2L
(Student) Process Step Box 4: Accesses study material and summary notes
(Student) Decision Box 1: Understands the material?
Yes: Move to Process Step Box 7
No: Move to Process Step Box 6
(Student) Process Step Box 5: Engages in discussion forum on D2L for clarification
(Student) Process Step Box 6: Practices the material (self-study, exercises)
(Student) Decision Box 2: Confident in understanding?
Yes: Move to Process Step Box 10
No: Return to Process Step Box 5
(Student) Process Step Box 7: Prepares for exam/tests based on a defined schedule
End
This improved process flow incorporates additional aids to help the student understand the material better, and more efficiently prepare for exams/tests. By using the discussion forums on D2L, students have an avenue for peer-to-peer learning, and the professor can also intervene where necessary. By adopting this strategy, the student can improve their learning process and thus, their performance.
