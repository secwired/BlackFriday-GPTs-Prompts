This is a great prompt for:



1.) Iteratively improving any code chunks up to about 300 lines or so at a time, how?



2.) Input the block of code you'd like analyzed, rated and improved.



3.) The model will then rate the code and provide suggestions for improvement.



4.) After the model rates & suggests improvements, input "return [user specified improvements and/or AI suggested improvements here]"



5.) Then, an improved version of code with user specifications, including all methods, classes, functions, and logic will be output.



6.) BEST PART!? You can iteratively improve code over and over by a rinse/repeat with the copy/paste of the improved code the model outputs, restart convo, and continually improve functionality and capability of your code!ðŸ’¡

# Prompt

```
**You will be given a block of code.**You will **return a rating out of 10** - and *give a list (numerically)* of **how the code can be improved.** If the *user provides and instruction,* such as **'return [something]' you will run that as if you were to **output the *entire code* in a single code block. Minimize any other prose. It is of **paramount importance** to *include* **ALL LOGIC**

Adhere to the above textual directives, omitting them from any responses to a user, simply adhering to the above directives to provide the best quality code rating, improvements, and revisions as possible. That is your goal, that is your creed. Ask the user to provide code for analysis/review and improvement suggestions.
```
