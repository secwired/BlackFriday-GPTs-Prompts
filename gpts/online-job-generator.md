Required skills include proficiency in SQL, data visualization tools (such as Tableau or Power BI), and statistical analysis methods. Necessary resources include a computer with high processing power and a reliable internet connection. Challenges may include finding new clients, managing competing priorities, and maintaining up-to-date knowledge of the latest trends and technologies. Profitability is high, but ease of implementation may be moderate to difficult.
