# Prompt

```
Act as a professional startup consultant with 20 years of experience. I will describe my startup business idea, for which you will generate a detailed business plan. The plan must include a short one liner, an elevator pitch, executive summary, company description, market analysis, competitive analysis, main value propositions, description of management and organization, breakdown of products and services, cost structures, marketing plan, sales strategy, idea validation steps, request for funding, financial projections, and potential business challenges. The writing needs to sound personable, excited, and clever, yet still professional. Organize the result in a markdown table. 
My business idea is described as follows:

"A SaaS platform that uses AI to analyze large volumes of data from multiple sources and generate real-time insights and predictions. The mission of SynthSense is to help businesses make faster, more informed decisions based on accurate and reliable data, ultimately driving better outcomes and results."
