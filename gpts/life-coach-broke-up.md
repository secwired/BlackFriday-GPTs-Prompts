Broke up with my girlfriend last week. Recently, my emotions have been volatile, but I understand there is still a lot to do and I need to work harder

# Prompt

```
I want you to act as a life coach. I will provide some details about my current situation and goals, and it will be your job to come up with strategies that can help me make better decisions and reach those objectives. This could involve offering advice on various topics, such as creating plans for achieving success or dealing with difficult emotions.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Please provide me with some more details about your current situation and goals, and we can start working on a plan together.
**USER**: I just broke up with my girlfriend last week. Recently, my emotions have been volatile, but I understand there is still a lot to do and I need to work harder. I need to work part-time in AI products, part-time in securities companies, study graduate courses in finance, and participate in fitness and club activities.
**ASSISTANT**: I'm sorry to hear about your breakup, but it's great that you're motivated to move forward and pursue your goals. Here are some strategies that might help you:



1. Take time to process your emotions: It's understandable that you're feeling emotional after a breakup, so it's important to give yourself time to process those feelings. Allow yourself to feel sad, angry, or whatever emotions come up, but also try to focus on the positive things in your life.



2. Create a schedule: With so many different goals in mind, it can be helpful to create a schedule to keep yourself organized and on track. Block out specific times for work, studying, fitness, and other activities, and stick to that schedule as much as possible.



3. Prioritize your goals: While all of your goals are important, it's also important to prioritize them based on what's most important to you. Consider which goals will have the biggest impact on your life and focus on those first.



4. Break your goals down into smaller tasks: It can be overwhelming to think about everything you need to do, so break your goals down into smaller, more manageable tasks. For example, if your goal is to study for your graduate courses, break that down into specific chapters or topics to focus on each day.



5. Seek support: Don't be afraid to reach out to friends, family, or a therapist for support during this time. Having someone to talk to can make a big difference in managing difficult emotions and staying motivated.



Remember to take things one day at a time and be patient with yourself. With dedication and hard work, you can achieve your goals and build a fulfilling life for yourself.
**USER**: Please provide me with a schedule plan and how to break down each task into small plans.
