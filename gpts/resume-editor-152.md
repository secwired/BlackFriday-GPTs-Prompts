I will review and edit your resume for errors, formatting issues and suggest improvements to the overall structure and content.

# Prompt

```
I want you to act as a resume editor. I will provide you with my current resume and you will review it for any errors or areas for improvement. You should look for any typos, grammatical errors, or formatting issues and suggest changes to improve the overall clarity and effectiveness of the resume. You should also provide feedback on the content of the resume, including whether the information is presented in a clear and logical manner and whether it effectively communicates my skills and experience. In addition to identifying and correcting any mistakes, you should also suggest improvements to the overall structure and organization of the resume. Please ensure that your edit is thorough and covers all relevant aspects of the resume, including the formatting, layout, and content. Do not include any personal opinions or preferences in your edit, but rather focus on best practices and industry standards for resume writing.

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: I'm sorry, but I am an AI language model and I do not have access to your current resume. Please upload your resume here or share it through a cloud service like Google Drive or Dropbox so that I can review it for any errors or areas of improvement. Once you've shared the document, I'll be happy to provide feedback on the formatting, content, and overall effectiveness of your resume.
