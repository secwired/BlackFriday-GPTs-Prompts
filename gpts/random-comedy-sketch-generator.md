## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: INT. A FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT



We see two people sitting at a table in a fancy restaurant. One of them is CINDY, a bubbly and chatty socialite, dressed in a designer gown, and the other is DAVE, a scruffy-looking truck driver in his work clothes.



Cindy: (excitedly) Dave, I'm so glad you could make it tonight!



Dave: (uncomfortable) Yeah, Cindy, me too.



Cindy: (noticing Dave's discomfort) What's wrong, Dave? You seem nervous.



Dave: (awkwardly) Well, to be honest, I've never been to a restaurant like this before.



Cindy: (surprised) Really? But Dave, don't you have any fancy restaurants where you live?



Dave: (sheepishly) Not really. I usually just eat at diners or fast-food joints.



Cindy: (impressed) Wow, you must be really excited then! This place serves the most exquisite meals.



As they look through the menu, the waiter comes over, carrying a silver tray with two glasses of water.



Waiter: (in a thick French accent) Bonjour, mesdames et messieurs. Can I offer you something to drink?



Cindy: (flirtatiously) Oh, yes please. I'll have a glass of your finest champagne.



Dave: (nervously) Uh, I think I'll stick with water.



The waiter nods and pours champagne into Cindy's glass. Suddenly, he spills some on her dress.



Waiter: Oh no! I am sorry, madame! Let me get you a napkin.



Cindy: (horrified) My dress! This is a couture gown from Paris!



She looks around for something to clean it up with and grabs Dave's sleeve by mistake.



Cindy: (embarrassed) Oh, I'm sorry, Dave. I thought this was a napkin.



Dave: (frustrated) Cindy, what the hell? You ruined my work shirt!



Cindy: (defensive) Well, it's not like I did it on purpose.



Dave: (sarcastically) Yeah, I can tell.



As they continue bickering, the waiter returns with a napkin and tries to clean up the spilled champagne. However, he accidentally knocks over the table, causing all the dishes to crash onto the floor.



Waiter: Oh no! I am so sorry, mesdames et messieurs!



Cindy and Dave look at each other, then burst out laughing.



Cindy: (wiping away tears of laughter) This is the most fun I've had in ages!



Dave: (smiling) Yeah, me too. Who knew fancy restaurants could be so entertaining?



They high-five each other as the scene ends.



FADE TO BLACK.
