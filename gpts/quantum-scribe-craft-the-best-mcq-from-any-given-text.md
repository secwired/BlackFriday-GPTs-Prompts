**USER**: ± associated subchondral marrow edema



Especially if full-thickness defect



However, subchondral marrow edema does not prove full-thickness defect



Displaced fragments may be in several locations



Remain in situ (fluid surrounds detached fragment in defect)



Within joint adjacent to defect



Likely due to small point of attachment



Remotely displaced within joint



Joint effusion



Helpful for identifying small defects and associated small intraarticular bodies



Dark-line sign: appearance of cartilage fissuring



Interface of juxtaposed pieces of cartilage without fluid interposed



Chronic injury



Over time, defect may be filled by scar



Scar is type I collagen instead of type II, as found in normal hyaline cartilage



Though scar cartilage may appear same as normal articular cartilage, its compressive properties and resistance to shear stress are inferior



Eventually may be undetectable on MR



Sharp edges become smoother



Underlying marrow edema resolves



Chronic subchondral sclerosis may develop



Intraarticular bodies may



Resorb



Become synovialized (adherent to synovial lining)



Remain loose within joint



Become ossified



Imaging Recommendations



Best imaging tool



MR



Some advocate MR arthrography for better sensitivity for small defects and intraarticular bodies



CT arthrography effective alternative if contraindication to MR



Protocol advice



Wide variety of pulse sequences have been advocated for cartilage lesion detection



Some are highly specific for cartilage imaging



Specific pulse sequence selection is often matter of personal preference



In routine clinical practice, high-resolution FSE/TSE intermediate or T2 MR suffice



Fat suppression optional



Osteochondral Fracture/Injury



Involves underlying bone in addition to articular cartilage



Degenerative Joint Disease (Osteoarthritis)
