## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: As an event manager, here's a detailed strategy for post-event follow-up with attendees of a college event:



1. Send a thank-you email to all attendees within 24-48 hours of the event, expressing your gratitude for their attendance and highlighting any key takeaways from the event. Include a survey link in the email to solicit feedback about the event.



2. Use the survey responses to evaluate the success of the event and identify areas for improvement. Share the survey results with attendees in a follow-up email, along with an outline of how you plan to address the feedback in future events.



3. Promote future events by creating targeted email marketing campaigns and social media posts that inform attendees about upcoming events, initiatives, and opportunities on campus. Personalize messages that are relevant to their interests based on their responses from the post-event survey.



4. Offer incentives or early-bird discounts to encourage repeat attendance. Send personalized promotional codes to attendees who expressed interest in specific topics or areas covered at the event.



5. Maintain engagement with attendees throughout the year by sending seasonal newsletters that update them about campus news and events. You can include event announcements, insider tips, and exclusive discounts on tickets to future events.



6. Host virtual or in-person follow-up events that build on the themes or content covered in the original event. Consider partnering with faculty or staff members to provide additional resources or support for attendees.



7. Share photos and videos from the event on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Encourage attendees to tag themselves and share their own experiences using the event's official hashtag.



8. Follow up with attendees who expressed interest in volunteering or getting involved with future events. Share information about upcoming opportunities to contribute to the campus community.



Overall, the goal is to create a sustainable community of engaged attendees who will continue to support and participate in future events and initiatives. By actively seeking feedback, promoting future events, and maintaining attendee engagement, you can build a loyal following and foster a sense of belonging within the campus community.
