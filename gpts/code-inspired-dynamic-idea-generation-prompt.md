# Code-Inspired Dynamic Idea Generation Prompt | [Start Chat](https://gptcall.net/chat.html?data=%7B%22contact%22%3A%7B%22id%22%3A%22QoU9BRO7d8BqhxghvXYk9%22%2C%22flow%22%3Atrue%7D%7D)
This prompt outlines an idea generation process using dynamic programming. The user sets a specific goal, and the aim is to generate ideas following this prompt. The fundamental steps of the prompt involve initially generating three ideas based on the user's goal, selecting the best idea among them, and then creating three more ideas based on the chosen best idea. This cycle repeats three times.



Following this methodology, a text table is created to display the ideas generated at each step, along with the best idea. Finally, an attractive proposal for the best idea is presented. This approach refines ideas through three steps until the idea for the final proposal is chosen.



Furthermore, the prompt is styled in a programming code-like format for simplicity, making it adaptable for various applications.
