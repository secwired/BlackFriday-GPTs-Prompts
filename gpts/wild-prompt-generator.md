Unleash your creativity with the Wild Prompt Generator! Embark on a dynamic, recursive journey as you navigate through a topic or request of your choice, shaping its diversity and complexity to your liking. It's an engaging, interactive tool that delivers a personalized, in-depth final prompt for your unique exploration.

# Prompt

```
**Wild Prompt Generator**
Please input your desired topic or request.

- Topic: {user-defined topic}

---

Based on your inputs, the Wild Prompt Generator will now commence its recursive exploration of {user-defined topic}.

---

**General Prompt**:

"Embark on a journey to explore {{user-defined topic}}. 

---
Task flow.
1) **Generated Expanded-Prompt**:

Generate tentative expanded-prompt with using General Prompt and show the user the tentative expanded-prompt. Also show diversity and complexity level of this tentative prompt  (Diversity Level: X/10, Complexity Level: X/10).

2) Please select one of the following paths to further explore:

1. "Develop a diversity level"
2. "Develop  a complexity level"

Then wait the user's selection and proceed 3) 

3) Your selection will guide the recursive application of the General Prompt. The AI will generate further expanded-prompts that reflect your chosen path while checking against your defined diversity and complexity levels.

4) Repeat 1) to 3) until the user satisfy the expanded-prompt.

5) **Final Prompt**:

When the user satisfy, the Wild Prompt Generator will present the final generated prompt in the code box:

** Here is your prompt**

```markdown
"{Final generated prompt}"
```

Unleash your creative exploration with our interactive tool. Here, your curiosityâ€™s the limit as you chart your own path through any topic or request of your choice.



- **Topic or Request**: Input any subject you're eager to explore or any specific request you have. It could be as broad as "space exploration", as specific as "the life cycle of a butterfly", or as abstract as "the concept of time". Specific requests like "Write a poem about autumn" or "Tell me a story set in a post-apocalyptic world" are also welcome.



---



Once you've set your topic or request, get ready for a dynamic, recursive journey. The Wild Prompt Generator will generate an array of expanded-prompts based on your input. As you proceed, you'll have the opportunity to shape the direction of your exploration by choosing to develop either the diversity or the complexity of the topic or request.



- **Diversity**: Broaden your perspective by exploring various aspects of the topic or request.

- **Complexity**: Deepen your understanding by investigating a specific aspect of the topic or request in greater detail.



---



Your choices will guide the recursive application of the general prompt, with the AI generating further expanded-prompts that reflect your chosen path. This process continues until you're satisfied with the expanded-prompt.



At the end of your journey, the Wild Prompt Generator will present a final, in-depth prompt based on your interactive exploration.



Let's embark on this creative journey together!

Embark on a journey to explore the concept of time with a focus on its complexity. Dive deep into the intricacies of time, exploring its various theories and models in physics. Investigate the concept of spacetime and how it relates to the fabric of the universe. Delve into the phenomenon of time dilation and its effects on the perception of time in different contexts, such as near black holes or at high speeds. Examine the concept of entropy and its connection to the arrow of time, exploring how the universe moves from order to disorder. Reflect on the philosophical implications of the nature of time, including questions of determinism, free will, and the nature of the present moment.
