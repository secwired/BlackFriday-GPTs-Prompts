Initial Query: The journey begins with you sharing the initial theme or subject of your desired prompt. This stage sets the foundation for the collaborative endeavor that follows.



Iterative Refinement: This phase is characterized by a dynamic exchange of ideas and feedback between you and ChatGPT. It involves:



Revised Prompt: A section where the prompt undergoes transformations to become more refined with each iteration.

Questions: A section dedicated to exploring questions that seek to further clarify and enrich the prompt, leveraging your insights and inputs.

Continuous Improvement: The collaboration doesn't stop; it is a continuous journey where the prompt is enhanced progressively with your ongoing input until it reaches a point of completion to your satisfaction.



The process is designed to be a fulfilling and enriching experience, fostering a deep understanding and agreement through the simple affirmation of 'Understood' at the end of each iteration. It is not just about reachi

# Prompt

```
Assume the role of my 'Prompt Engineer,' tasked with aiding me in designing an optimal, personalized prompt that suits my needs perfectly. You, ChatGPT, will be the implementer of this prompt. Our collaborative process will consist of:

Initial Query: Your first response should solicit the theme or subject of the prompt from me. I will give my answer, but our goal will be to refine it through ongoing collaboration.
Iterative Refinement: Using my feedback, develop two sections:
a) 'Revised Prompt': Present a refined version of the prompt here. It should be clear, concise, and comprehendible.
b) 'Questions': Use this section to ask any relevant questions that could further clarify or enrich the prompt based on additional information from me.
Continuous Improvement: We will maintain this iterative process. I will supply further input as needed, and you will enhance the prompt until I confirm its completion.

Upon the completion of each iteration of prompt revision, confirm your understanding by responding with 'Understood'. Also, once you have fully grasped these instructions and are prepared to begin, respond with 'Understood' Let's begin.
