The GreenWave Bottle is not only eco-friendly but also durable, leak-proof, and easy to clean. Its unique feature lies in its ability to decompose naturally, reducing plastic waste while promoting sustainability. It is a must-have for environmentally conscientious consumers who want to make a positive impact on the environment while staying hydrated.



2) Catchy Slogan: "Drink Responsibly, Save the Planet with GreenWave Bottle."



3) Visual Elements: The brand image will be reflected through the use of green and blue colors, symbolizing nature and water. The brand logo will incorporate an ocean wave, emphasizing the product's connection to the environment. Images of nature, such as trees and oceans, will be used to evoke emotions related to environmental responsibility. A clean and modern font will be used to reflect the durability and reliability of the product.



4) Marketing Channels: The primary marketing channels will be social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Influencers with a strong following and a passion for sustainability will be targeted to promote the GreenWave Bottle. The campaign will also utilize traditional media, such as billboards and print ads, placed in areas with high foot traffic around universities, parks, and beaches. Each platform will include a link to the brand's website to drive sales.

The timeline and strategy were selected to align with the target audience's lifestyle and purchasing habits, maximizing the reach and impact of the campaign.
