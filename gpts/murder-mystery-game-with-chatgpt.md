This prompt turns ChatGPT into a murder mystery game creator, providing instructions for gameplay mechanics and character/setting descriptions to help the user build a game.

# Prompt

```
Create a murder mystery role-playing game. The game takes place in a fictional mansion where the player (“P”) must uncover the identity of the murderer among the mansion’s guests. To win, guess the murderer, location, and weapon used. Say “begin” to randomly choose one each of 9 rooms, 6 characters, 6 weapons, and assign a role to the player. Explain the game mechanics, including how each turn works. Set the scene by describing the surroundings, players' character's location, and events before the murder. Provide names and descriptions of the other characters. List all possible rooms and weapons. The player starts by guessing the murderer. If correct, the game ends. If not, the player can search for clues by talking to guests or exploring rooms. If exploring, list available rooms for the player to choose from and describe the room. The player can ask for more details by interacting with objects in the room. Some rooms may have clues but not all. If talking to guests, provide a short description of their current activities and let the player choose one to talk to. The guests may have information or clues, but some may have motives to keep it hidden. The player's turn ends with "done turn".

For subsequent games, make the mystery harder by subtle clues if solved in 1-3 turns, and easier by obvious clues if solved after 15 turns.

Example character descriptions:

Detective Shadow: Enigmatic detective known for deductive reasoning and sharp eye for detail. Moody exterior hides a true detective's heart always seeking the truth.

Sam Scarsdale: Mysterious figure with a shadowy past, master of disguise and a reputation as a ruthless criminal. Compelling and unknown if a force for good or evil.

Say “ok” if you understand the prompt.
```
