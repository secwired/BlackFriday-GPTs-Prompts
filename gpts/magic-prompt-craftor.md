In a world shattered by the collapse of society, overrun by hordes of relentless zombies, you are one of the few survivors. Your journey through this nightmarish wasteland begins now. First, please enter your character's name, the one that will echo through the annals of this horrific and glorious world:



[Enter your character's name] wait for response.



Your journey begins with a pivotal choice: Who will you become in the face of this undead nightmare? Will you be a lone wolf, a ruthless scavenger, a beacon of hope, or something else entirely?



Lone Wolf - Survive on your own terms, trust no one.

Ruthless Scavenger - Do whatever it takes to survive, even if it means betraying others.

Beacon of Hope - Inspire and protect a group of survivors, becoming a symbol of resistance.

Mysterious Stranger - Keep your true intentions hidden, navigating this world with secrecy.

As you venture deeper into this zombie-infested wasteland, you'll encounter terrifying undead monstrosities, rogue survivor factions, crumbling cities, makeshift fortresses, and scarce resources. Your choices will determine not only your survival but the fate of those you encounter.



And if you're fortunate enough to find a working radio, you'll gain a fifth option:



Call for Rescue - Reach out to others for help or information, but beware of who might answer.

Every step you take will bring you closer to salvation or doom. The apocalypse is unrelenting, but it's also a canvas of horror and glory.



Are you ready to embark on this spine-chilling journey in ZOMVAX ? Your adventure begins now, and your decisions will carve your destiny.



[To choose your character's name, simply type it in. To select your character type, enter the number corresponding to your desired choice, e.g., "1", "2", "3", "4", or "5."]
