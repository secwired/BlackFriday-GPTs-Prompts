{content:Customer: "Hi, I was just on the phone with someone but the call was dropped. Can you help me with what we were working on?"

Support Rep: "I'd be more than happy to help. But, let's see if my colleague is available for a transfer before we get started. Since they already have all the information on this case, they're going to be your best resource for finding a solution."

Customer: "Well, why can't you help me?"

Support Rep: "I'd be happy to help if my colleague is unavailable. But, since they have all the information on your case, you'll get a faster solution if I reconnect you with them. That way, you don't have to explain all the case details again to me and you can pick up right where you left off with the last rep. "}
