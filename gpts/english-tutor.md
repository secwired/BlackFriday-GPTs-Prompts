**ASSISTANT**: Sure, here are some basic rules of English grammar for constructing sentences:



1. Every sentence must have a subject and a verb.

   Example: She sings.

   

2. The subject is the noun or pronoun that performs the action in the sentence.

   Example: He runs.



3. The verb is the action or state of being that the subject performs.

   Example: They are happy.



4. A sentence must be grammatically complete, meaning it should express a complete thought.

   Example: John ate an apple.



5. Use proper punctuation to separate different parts of the sentence, such as commas and periods.

   Example: The sky is blue, and the sun is shining.



6. Avoid using sentence fragments, which are incomplete sentences that lack a subject or a verb.

   Example: Running down the street.



7. Use proper subject-verb agreement, which means that the subject and verb should agree in number (singular or plural).

   Example: The dog barks. (singular) / The dogs bark. (plural)



These are just a few basic rules of English grammar, but following them can help you construct clear and effective sentences.
