【Clinical evaluation】: Positive

【Clinical conclusion】: In this clinical trial, three groups of patients with advanced lung cancer were treated with different drugs (A, B, and C). The overall response rates (ORR) for Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3 were 50%, 40%, and 35%, respectively. The complete response (CR) rates were 20%, 10%, and 5%, and the partial response (PR) rates were 30% for all groups. The median overall survival (mOS) was 12.5 months, 11.2 months, and 10.8 months for Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3, respectively. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 70%, 65%, and 60% of patients in each group, with grade 3 AEs occurring in 20%, 15%, and 12% of patients, and grade 4 AEs occurring in 5%, 3%, and 2% of patients. Based on these results, the clinical trial showed positive efficacy outcomes for all three treatment groups.
**USER**: Background: Results of conventional induction chemotherapies in PCNSL need to be improved. Ibrutinib, a BTK inhibitor, and lenalidomide, an immunomodulatory drug, have shown promising results in the relapse setting, supporting to further assess their combination with standard high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy. Methods: Patients (pts) with newly diagnosed PCNSL, aged 18 to 60, were randomized to receive four 28-day cycles of either ibrutinib or lenalidomide in combination with R-MPV (rituximab, methotrexate, procarbazine, vincristine and prednisone) in a 3+3 design for ibrutinib 420/560/280 mg (D3 to D14 and D17 to D28) and lenalidomide 20 mg D1 to 14/20 mg D1 to 21/15 mg D1 to 21. Responder pts then received a consolidation with R-Cytarabine and an intensive chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation. The objective of the phase IB study was to define the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) based on the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurring during the first induction cycle. We present the results of the phase IB, including the toxicities that occurred throughout induction therapy. Results: 26 pts (median age 52) were randomized, 13 in each treatment group. Four DLTs (/21 evaluable pts) have been observed: grade 5 aspergillosis and pneumocystosis (N=1, ibrutinib 560 mg and concurrent high-dose corticosteroids without prophylaxis), grade 4 catheter-related infection > 7 days (N=1, lenalidomide 20 mg D1-14) and grade 3 increased alanine aminotransferase > 7 days (N=1, lenalidomide 20 mg D1-14 and N=1, lenalidomide 15 mg D1-21). RP2D of ibrutinib and lenalidomide were 560 mg (D3-14 and D17-28) and 15 mg (D1-21) respectively, in combination with R-MPV. One Lyell’s syndrome was reported as a serious adverse event (AE) at cycle 2 in the lenalidomide arm. Grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs occurring in ≥2 pts at any time during induction treatment are detailed in the table. After 4 induction cycles, 3/11 evaluable pts had CR/CRu and 7/11 had partial response (PR) in the ibrutinib group. In the lenalidomide arm, 6/10 evaluable pts had CR/CRu and 4/10 had PR. Survivals will be presented. Conclusions: Targeted induction immunochemotherapy with ibrutinib or lenalidomide and R-MPV is feasible for newly diagnosed PCNSL and shows promising response rates. Adverse events should be monitored carefully. The phase II part of the study is ongoing and opened to patients up to 65 years old. Clinical trial information: NCT04446962.

Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related AEs (≥ 2 pts).

【Clinical evaluation】: Promising response rates

【Clinical conclusion】: In this phase IB study, patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL were randomized to receive either lenalidomide + R-MPV or ibrutinib + R-MPV. The treatment with lenalidomide + R-MPV resulted in 6 out of 10 evaluable patients achieving complete response/complete response unconfirmed (CR/CRu), and 4 out of 10 patients achieving partial response (PR). On the other hand, the treatment with ibrutinib + R-MPV resulted in 3 out of 11 evaluable patients achieving CR/CRu and 7 out of 11 patients achieving PR. The most common grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events were hepatic cytolysis (38% in lenalidomide + R-MPV and 33% in ibrutinib + R-MPV) and neutropenia (23% in lenalidomide + R-MPV and 25% in ibrutinib + R-MPV). Other adverse events such as thrombocytopenia, anemia, lymphocytopenia, sepsis, and catheter-related infection were also reported. Based on these results, targeted induction immunochemotherapy with either lenalidomide + R-MPV or ibrutinib + R-MPV shows promising response rates for newly diagnosed PCNSL. Adverse events should be carefully monitored.
