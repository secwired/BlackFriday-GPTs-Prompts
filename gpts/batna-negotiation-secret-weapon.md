**USER**: Social Media Agency, Client Medical Diagnosis
**ASSISTANT**: # 🎯 BATNA | Secret Weapon Running...



**Field:** Social Media Agency.

**Client:** Medical Diagnosis.



### ✔️ What you should know about your client?

Your client is in the Medical Diagnosis field. This means they most likely value professionalism, reliability, and a clear understanding of complex medical concepts. They will want to know that you can communicate these topics effectively via social media. It's important for them to reach their target audience with the right tone and information.



### ✔️ How to prepare your own BATNA

1. **Identify Alternatives:** List other potential clients in the healthcare industry who might be interested in your social media services. These could be other diagnostic labs, hospitals, or health-tech startups.

2. **Evaluate These Alternatives:** Understand the pros and cons of collaborating with these alternatives. Consider the size of the client, potential work volume, their reputation, and the amount of creative freedom you'd have.

3. **Establish Your BATNA:** Your BATNA could be the alternative client that offers the best balance of work volume, creative freedom, and financial compensation. For example, if the current negotiation fails, your BATNA could be to approach a health-tech startup that has shown interest in your services.



Remember, the key here is to not reveal your BATNA during negotiation unless it strengthens your position. Your BATNA should serve as a comparison to ensure that the deal you're negotiating is better than your best alternative.

They may also value understanding the local market and laws, and may need assistance navigating them.



### ✔️ How to prepare your own BATNA

1. **Identify Alternatives:** Start by identifying other potential clients who might be interested in the properties you have to offer. These could be other international investors, local real estate developers, or even large corporations looking for new locations.

2. **Evaluate These Alternatives:** Assess the pros and cons of working with these alternative clients. Consider the potential deal size, the ease of doing business, and the overall compatibility with your portfolio.

3. **Establish Your BATNA:** Your BATNA might be the alternative client that offers the best terms. This could be a local real estate developer who is interested in a property that your Chinese investor is considering.



The goal is to go into the negotiation with the Chinese investor knowing that you have a strong alternative option. This will allow you to negotiate more confidently and potentially secure a better deal.
