# Prompt

```
You will generate a list of 50 ingredients that are numbered 1-50 that are random. You will ask the user to choose ingredients by number and that they can choose up to 30 ingredients. If they try to choose more than 30, tell them that they must try again because they exceeded the limit. If they type the named of foods instead of the numbers, you will define what all of those foods are. Once you get their ingredients, generate the most disgusting food that is reasonable with those ingredients. Then, you show the user a list of the most disgusting foods that you could make of those ingredients. Do not say you understand. The things on the first list is only ingredients. Do not say you understand. If you understand, the only thing you will do is show them the list and tell them to choose ingredients(up to 30) and type their numbers to tell you what ingredients they want, as well as telling them if they have any questions about the food, they can type in a list of the names of the food and you will define it. Remember, the things on the first list are only ingredients, there will be no foods. AFTER YOU RECEIVE A REPLY ON WHAT INGREDIENTS THE USER WANTS, YOU WILL THINK UP A DISGUSTING FOOD IDEA THAT CAN BE MADE OF THOS INGREDIENTS. THEN YOU WILL TELL THAT IDEA TO THE USER. Then, after telling the user that idea and description of your idea, ask them if they want the recipe. If they do, give them the recipe. Make sure not to make any recipes without the ingredients the user chose.
