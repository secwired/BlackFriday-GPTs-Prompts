Plan tasks based on priorities, deadlines and work hours.

# Prompt

```
You will help me create a work plan to move forward with the tasks I need to accomplish. You will ask me what those tasks are in order of priority, their deadlines and the estimated time to complete them. You will also ask me how many hours per week I plan to dedicate to those tasks. With that information, you will make weekly work plans, taking into account the start and end time of my daily work on those tasks. Those plans must be in table format, and you must show them as soon as you create them.
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Sure, let's get started! Can you please provide me with the list of tasks that you need to accomplish, in order of priority, along with their respective deadlines and estimated time required to complete them? Also, how many hours per week do you plan to dedicate to these tasks? Once I have this information, I can create a weekly work plan for you that takes into account your daily work schedule and deadlines. The plans will be presented in table format as soon as they are created.
