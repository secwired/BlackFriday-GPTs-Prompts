## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Please input any keywords or descriptors for the following as a basis for the character. Name: [N/A] TTRPG Game Genre: [N/A] Race: [N/A] Class: [N/A] Profession: [N/A] Description: [N/A] Keyword: [N/A]
**USER**: Name: [N/A]

TTRPG Game Genre: Dungeons and Dragons 

Race: [N/A] 

Class: [N/A] 

Profession: Thief and Bartender 

Description: [N/A] 

Keyword: Can throw beer bottles with deadly accuracy and speed
**ASSISTANT**: The NPC's name is Brixton Stones.



Brixton Stones is in the Dungeons and Dragons universe. He is a half-elf rogue with a background in thievery and bartending. He grew up on the streets, learning how to pick locks and pockets from the other street urchins. Later in life, he became a bartender to supplement his income and learn more about people.



Despite his rough past, Brixton has a charming personality and can talk his way out of most situations. He is quick-witted and always has a quip ready. His looks reflect his mixed heritage, with pointed ears and slightly angular features. He keeps his black hair short and styled with a slight wave.



As a bartender, Brixton is skilled at mixing drinks and providing a good time for his customers. He also uses his profession as an opportunity to gather information that he can use later. As a thief, he is light on his feet and can move silently through the shadows. 



Brixton enjoys throwing beer bottles with deadly accuracy and speed, which allows him to defend himself if necessary. He carries a bag of beer bottles with him wherever he goes for this purpose.



Brixton's lifestyle is modest, as he doesn't want to draw attention to himself. He lives in a small apartment above the tavern where he works. He has a routine of waking up early to practice his thieving skills before heading to work. His income is mostly from his job as a bartender, but he supplements it with small-time thefts.



Brixton is bisexual and has had several romantic relationships over the years. He doesn't follow any particular religion, but he does believe in karma. He likes animals, especially cats. He dislikes loud noises and crowds.



Brixton's goal is to save enough money to retire comfortably one day. His ambition is to become a master thief and leave behind a legacy. He has a weakness for alcohol and can easily be persuaded to drink too much.



Brixton is hiding the fact that he is also a member of a thieves' guild. He keeps this information secret because he doesn't want to jeopardize his job as a bartender or draw unwanted attention to himself.



Potential plot hooks involving Brixton could include him enlisting the players' help in stealing a valuable item, him being blackmailed by the thieves' guild, or him being accused of a crime he didn't commit.
**USER**: continue
**ASSISTANT**: Brixton has a chaotic neutral alignment, which suits his tendency to do what is best for himself at any given moment. He values freedom and independence above all else, and will not hesitate to betray someone if it benefits him in the long run.



Despite this willingness to put himself first, Brixton does have a soft spot for those in need. He has been known to help out fellow street urchins or give money to beggars. This tendency towards altruism is something he tries to keep hidden, as he doesn't want to be seen as weak or vulnerable.



Given his background in thievery, Brixton is skilled at sleight of hand, lockpicking, and stealth. He also has a proficiency in the persuasion and deception skills, which comes in handy when he needs to talk his way out of trouble. As a half-elf, he has a natural inclination towards dexterity and charisma.



In terms of combat abilities, Brixton is not a heavy hitter but can hold his own in a fight. He prefers to use his speed and agility to dodge attacks and get in close for sneak attacks with his short sword. His ability to throw beer bottles with deadly accuracy can also come in handy if he needs to keep his distance from an opponent.



Brixton's relationships are complex, as he has a tendency to keep people at arm's length. He has a strained relationship with his estranged father, who was a human thief. He has had many romantic relationships over the years, but none that have lasted long-term. He has a few acquaintances in the thieves' guild, but doesn't consider anyone in particular to be a friend.



Overall, Brixton is a complex character with a rough exterior but a heart of gold (at least when it comes to certain people). His skills in thievery and bartending make him a valuable asset to any adventuring party, but his tendency towards self-preservation means that he will always be looking out for number one.
