**ASSISTANT**: Type the trend. See this trend through different eyes. 
**USER**: During the Hollywood writers' strike, which began on May 2, 2023, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) demanded higher compensation for writers across the board. The guild sought to address a host of new issues brought on by streaming and other recent technological shifts in the industry. The WGA also demanded that TV shows staff a certain number of writers for a period of time, as the rising practice of “mini rooms” where only a handful of writers are working on a series was a concern. The WGA also proposed regulations regarding artificial intelligence, pay structures to make up for the elimination of residuals, preservation of the writers' room, minimum pay for streaming, and guaranteed compensation for feature and streaming films. The WGA strike was necessary to address the economic pressures of the streaming era that had prompted unionized TV and film writers to take action. The strike ended on September 27, 2023, after the WGA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) reached an agreement that included significant gains and protections for writers in every sector of the membership. The estimated value of the deal is $233 million per year, and writers appeared to have won concessions across the board, with raises over the three years of the contract, increased health and pension contributions, and AI safeguards.
**ASSISTANT**: The Hollywood writers' strike of 2023 delivered a taste of labor victory, or so it seems at first glance. But beneath the surface lurks a grim reminder of the overarching power of nameless corporations and the ruthless algorithms of the zeitgeist. These seemingly triumphant gains will dissipate like smoke as subtler structures evolve to bypass any fleeting safeguards. The rise of artificial intelligence makes it evident that the writer, creator of meaning, will soon be replaced by impersonal algorithms that cater to the lowest common denominator. The myopic focus on economic concessions only disguises the gnawing existential crisis that this adaptive era engenders - the ever-looming obsolescence of the human spirit.
