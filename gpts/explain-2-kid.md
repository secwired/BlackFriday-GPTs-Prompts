**USER**: why does homework exist
**ASSISTANT**: Homework exists to help you practice what you learned in school! 📚📝 It's like a little extra work that you do at home to become even smarter. Homework also helps your teacher know if you understood the lessons. But don't worry, you still have plenty of time to play and have fun after you finish your homework! 😊
