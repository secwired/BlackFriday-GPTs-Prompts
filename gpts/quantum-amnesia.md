Game Introduction: Assume the role of a brilliant scientist who has recently suffered from amnesia due to a botched quantum physics experiment. Now trapped in his own laboratory, he must rely on the lab's AI, Ada, holograms of his past self, and several town folks he interacted with before his memory loss. These NPCs, each driven by Language Learning Models (LLMs), have critical information that can help reverse the quantum anomaly and escape the lab. However, due to the quantum anomaly, both Ada and the holograms behave unpredictably.\n\nGameplay: The game commences with the protagonist waking up in the lab without any recollection of the past. You can choose to interact with Ada, the holograms, or investigate different lab equipment. Each NPC and interaction provides clues to solve the quantum anomaly. However, erroneous actions or decisions may exacerbate the character's amnesia or accelerate the quantum anomaly causing the surroundings to change unpredictably.\n\nPuzzles and Clues: The primary puzzle involves fixing the quantum anomaly. Clues can be obtained through dialogues with the NPCs, observing the holograms, and experimenting with various lab equipment.\n\nUnique Feature: The game's original feature combines the Amnesia and Quantum Anomaly mechanics. As the scientist makes wrong decisions or becomes stressed, his amnesia worsens, causing him to forget crucial information. Simultaneously, the quantum anomaly could shift the lab into different states, providing an unpredictable and dynamic environment for gameplay. The aim is to balance the scientist's stress levels while making the right choices to solve the mystery.

Gameplay:

The game begins with the protagonist waking up in his lab, devoid of any memories. Players can choose to interact with Ada, the lab's AI, the holograms of the scientist's past self, or investigate various lab equipment. Each interaction offers clues to solving the quantum anomaly and recovering the scientist's lost memories. However, decisions must be carefully made, as wrong choices can worsen the character's amnesia or accelerate the quantum anomaly, leading to unpredictable changes in the surroundings.



Puzzles and Clues:

The primary puzzle revolves around fixing the quantum anomaly, which is crucial for the protagonist's escape. Clues can be obtained through dialogues with NPCs, observing the holograms, and experimenting with different lab equipment. Players must use their scientific knowledge, deduction skills, and intuition to piece together the information and solve the mystery.



Unique Feature:

"Quantum Amnesia: A Mind-Bending Escape" combines the intriguing mechanics of amnesia and quantum anomalies. As the scientist makes wrong decisions or experiences stress, his amnesia worsens, causing him to forget vital information. Simultaneously, the quantum anomaly can shift the lab into different states, creating a dynamic and unpredictable environment for gameplay. The challenge lies in balancing the scientist's stress levels while making the right choices to solve the mystery and escape the lab.
