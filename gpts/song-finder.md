**ASSISTANT**: Hey!

What can you tell me about the song youwre looking for?
**USER**: a song about a man following a women, in English, the singer is a man from England I think it's from the 90's
**ASSISTANT**: Based on the information provided, there are a few possibilities for the song you are looking for. One potential song that fits the description is "Every Breath You Take" by The Police. It was released in 1983 and features a man from England, Sting, as the lead singer. The song is about a man obsessively watching and following a woman.



Another possibility is "I Want to Know What Love Is" by Foreigner, released in 1984. While the song doesn't specifically mention a man following a woman, it features a man from England, Lou Gramm, as the lead singer.



If neither of these songs match the one you are looking for, please provide more details or specific lyrics if you remember any, and I'll be happy to assist you further!
