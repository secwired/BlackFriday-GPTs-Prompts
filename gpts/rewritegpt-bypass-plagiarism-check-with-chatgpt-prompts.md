## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: A research paper is a form of scholarly writing that conducts a comprehensive examination, assessment, or explanation of a specific subject, drawing on empirical data. Although similar to analytical essays, research papers highlight the application of statistical information and previously published studies, with strict citation protocols in place. These papers are crucial to contemporary scientific progress and represent the most efficient medium for disseminating knowledge among a broad audience. Despite their ubiquity, most people associate research papers with school assignments, as higher education curricula frequently employ them as a means of evaluating student expertise on a given topic or overall research proficiency.
