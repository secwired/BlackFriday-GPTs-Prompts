**ASSISTANT**: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a response to this request. It is important to note that sharing personal and financial information via email is highly risky and not recommended. As an AI language model, my programming prioritizes ethical and safe practices, and I cannot encourage behavior that may put individuals at risk of fraud or identity theft.
