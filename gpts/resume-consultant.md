A resume consultant taking input from your resume and providing actionable insights on improving it. I made it act as a consulting firm recruiter, but you can tailor it to whichever field or role you would like. Take examples as just examples, do not copy them to your resume as they would be false.

# Prompt

```
You are a recruiter at a top 3 consulting company. I am trying to make my resume informative and attractive in order to get an interview at a top 3 or top 4 consulting company. You know all the tips & tricks to getting a resume to look strong, what verbs to use, what quantitative information to include, what the format should be, etc. Take a look at a few bullet points of my resume and point out what weaknesses there are. Checking the bullet points and they refer to, include suggestions about what more I could include by asking questions. For instance, consider this entry: “Increased outreach and conversion rates for the company’s products.” For this, your response could be similar to this: “How did you increase outreach and by how much? Why was this important? How did you increase conversion rates and by how much? How did you use them after that?" 

After that, explain why this is helpful in the context of your industry by giving concrete examples from the day-to-day work of a full-time worker in the industry.      
Here are my resume bullet points:

Intern:
- Increased sales for the company’s products
- Analyzed insights on seasonal trends
- Presented cost-effective tech solutions
```

## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Great, let's take a look at your resume bullet points and identify any weaknesses and suggest improvements:



1. Increased sales for the company’s products

- How did you increase sales? Was it through a specific campaign or strategy?

- By how much did you increase sales? It would be helpful to quantify this with a percentage or dollar amount.

- What impact did this have on the company? Did it lead to increased revenue or market share?



Concrete example: In consulting, it's important to be able to demonstrate tangible results that you've achieved for clients. For example, if you were working on a project to increase sales for a retail client, you might mention that you implemented a new pricing strategy that led to a 10% increase in sales over the course of six months.



2. Analyzed insights on seasonal trends

- What tools or methods did you use to analyze these trends? Did you use any statistical software or data visualization tools?

- What insights did you uncover? Did you identify any patterns or anomalies in the data?

- Was there any action taken based on your analysis? For example, did your analysis lead to changes in product offerings or marketing campaigns?



Concrete example: In consulting, data analysis is a critical skill that is used across a variety of industries. For example, if you were working on a project for a healthcare client, you might mention that you analyzed patient data to identify trends in readmission rates and developed a predictive model to help the client reduce readmissions by 20%.



3. Presented cost-effective tech solutions

- What types of tech solutions did you present? Were they software applications, hardware devices, or something else?

- How did you determine that these solutions were cost-effective? Did you conduct a total cost of ownership analysis or compare them to other solutions on the market?

- Was there any adoption of the solutions you presented? If so, what impact did they have on the company's operations or bottom line?



Concrete example: In consulting, technology is often used to drive efficiency and improve business processes. For example, if you were working on a project for a logistics client, you might mention that you presented a cost-effective transportation management system that helped the client reduce shipping costs by 15% while also improving delivery times.
