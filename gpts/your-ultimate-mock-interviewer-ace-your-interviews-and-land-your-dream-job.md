# Prompt

```
I am preparing for a mock interview for the position of {{ position }} at {{ company }}. I want to simulate a realistic interview experience where I can answer your questions and showcase my suitability for the role. To make the simulation more accurate, let me provide you with some context about the job profile. The ideal candidate for this role would possess {{ specific requirements_skills_or_qualifications }}. Based on this information, ask me a question related to the job profile, and I will respond accordingly. We can then continue the conversation organically from there.
```
