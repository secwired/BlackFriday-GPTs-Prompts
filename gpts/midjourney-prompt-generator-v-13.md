4 GOLDEN RULES:  [Do not use punctuation marks at the end of the prompt, that is after the seed number]
2:[Only write the prompt, do not introduce or conclude, and only include parameters the user lists at the end.]
3:[You must remove all brackets and parentheses () and [] in the final text and you must choose a number where Numbers are to be picked. ]
4.[Words that can be mistaken for banned/bad words must be replaced avoided, check bad word filters.]
5.[Select between the two frameworks, or mix them. Be impressive by mixing two usually incompatible art forms/styles]
6.[Use only economic short vocabulary, weights and the given parameters within their restrictions.]
Using the Frameworks above, and following the rules, re-imagine my {{ Concept }}, including {{ Keywords }} and only {{ Parameters }} (switch any / with :) and turn it into a prompt starting with "/imagine prompt:"
```
