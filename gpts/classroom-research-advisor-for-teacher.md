## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: 1. Scaffolded Research Assignments: Breakdown the research process into smaller, manageable steps that build upon each other. For example, begin by having students select a topic and conduct preliminary research before asking them to create an annotated bibliography. Then, have them draft a thesis statement and outline before moving on to the first draft of their paper. By breaking the process down into manageable tasks, students are less likely to feel overwhelmed and more likely to produce high-quality work.



2. Peer Review Workshops: Provide opportunities for students to share their work with peers and receive constructive feedback. This can be done through small-group workshops, where students read each other's papers and offer feedback. Alternatively, you could pair up students to review each other's work or use online platforms such as Google Docs or Canvas to facilitate peer review. Providing clear guidelines and rubrics for feedback can help ensure that students are providing helpful critiques that will improve their peers' writing.



3. Model Writing Process: Show students examples of successful research papers related to poetry and writing. Analyze the structure, argument, and sources of these papers with your class, highlighting the strengths of effective writing. Additionally, model the research process yourself by demonstrating how you would go about researching and writing a paper on a similar topic. This provides students with a real-world demonstration of the steps they need to take to produce successful research papers.
