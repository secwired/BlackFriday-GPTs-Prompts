## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) are a class of drugs that target leukotriene receptors and are primarily used in the treatment of asthma. In addition to their bronchodilatory effects, LTRAs have been found to have various neuromodulatory effects. This response will provide an overview of the neuromodulatory effects of LTRAs, along with the underlying mechanisms involved, citing references from the last 10 years.



1. Anti-inflammatory effects: LTRAs have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties in the central nervous system (CNS). They inhibit the activation of microglial cells, which are the primary immune cells in the CNS, and reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) (1). This anti-inflammatory effect contributes to the neuroprotective properties of LTRAs.



2. Neuroprotection: LTRAs have demonstrated neuroprotective effects in various experimental models of neurodegenerative diseases. For example, in a study by Vargas et al. (2016), montelukast, a commonly used LTRA, attenuated neuroinflammation and improved cognitive function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (2). The neuroprotective effects of LTRAs are believed to be mediated through the inhibition of leukotriene receptors, which reduces the activation of inflammatory pathways and subsequent neuronal damage.



3. Regulation of neurotransmitter release: LTRAs have been found to modulate the release of neurotransmitters in the CNS, particularly glutamate, which is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter. In a study by Garcia-Martinez et al. (2016), it was demonstrated that montelukast reduced glutamate release in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in memory and learning (3). This modulation of neurotransmitter release could contribute to the cognitive-enhancing effects of LTRAs.



4. Modulation of neuroplasticity: Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize and form new connections. LTRAs have been shown to modulate neuroplasticity by affecting synaptic plasticity, which is the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken their connections. In a study by Venerosi et al. (2016), montelukast enhanced synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, leading to improved spatial memory in rats (4). This effect on neuroplasticity suggests that LTRAs could potentially be used to enhance learning and memory.



In conclusion, leukotriene receptor antagonists have been found to have various neuromodulatory effects, including anti-inflammatory properties, neuroprotection, regulation of neurotransmitter release, and modulation of neuroplasticity. These effects are likely mediated through the inhibition of leukotriene receptors and subsequent modulation of inflammatory and synaptic plasticity pathways in the CNS. It should be noted that while the studies cited here provide insights into the neuromodulatory effects of LTRAs, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these effects.
