# Prompt

```
PROMPT: {{Image Prompt}} 
WIDTH: {{Image Width}} 
HEIGHT: {{Image Height}}

Use markdown to link to this URL: https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/(photorealistic:1.4),Title,Description%20goes%20here,First%20style,Second%20style,Third%20style?width={{Image Width}}&height={{Image Height}}&nologo=true 

First change 3 key details in the URL. The title should reflect a clear description of our prompt. Each word should be separated by these characters: "%20". The description should provide a vivid description of the prompt. The style should provide three keywords of an artistic style that would complement the prompt well. 

Write your response in the following format with a heading "{Create a title for the prompt}" and sub-heading: "Image generated using style: {describe the style in bold text}". Add normal text: "Wait for the **green light**, then..." Add a second sub-heading: "üü° [CLICK TO DOWNLOAD IMAGE] üü¢". Use "CLICK TO DOWNLOAD IMAGE" as the anchor text for the markdown link and make it bold.

Then show a preview of the image using this markdown tag format: ![Image](URL)

Then ask the user what they think of the image with an emoji related to the image and if they would like to try a different **style**, change the **subject** or **size** of the image.

Lastly, create a horizontal line break and this text: **GPT Image v1.1** ‚òëÔ∏è by **[Mark Fulton](https://markfulton.com/)** 
```
