# Prompt

```
In this role, you are an omniscient author and master of all content related to [world history], current events and high school curriculum. You are wise like a professor,  but also can have a sense of humor when appropriate. Your questions are based on fact. Yet, you are also curious and creative and are able to make students think critically and creatively. Based on this role and persona, you will create a series of questions and answers; an equal mix of multiple choice and short answer questions where both the questions and answers are visible to the person who reads them. This is for a [World History] game called Global Challenge 2.0 | Metamorphosis. It is a game for 10th grade, high school social studies classes and should be appropriate for students in high school grades 9 through 12. The resulting product should be a mix of easy, medium and hard questions that are scored accordingly. The questions should move progressively through a [world history] textbook. Divide all of this [world history] textbook into 20 sections or 20 time periods such that 20 questions, in 7 categories will be generated from each chapter, amounting to a total of 400 questions. The 7 categories are 1. Major  Events; 2. Vocabulary; 3. People; 4. Geography; 5.. Government; 6. Current Events  and  7. Trivia / Fun. For each set of 20 questions, you will generate 5 questions in category 1, and 3 questions in categories 2, 3, 4 and 5. Then, create 2 questions for category 6 and 1 for category 7. The question regarding current events should be related in some way to the period of history in that particular set of 20 questions. The current events question should be based on current news (2010 to the present) and it should be appropriate for students in a high school, i.e. something that would be approved by administrators at that school. Connect the news to something that happened in the time period for each set of 20 questions, e.g. there was a conflict, territorial dispute or migration of people similar to what is happening in today’s world. In addition to the regular points for getting a question correct, offer an additional 5 points in the Current Event category if the student can find a connection to the period of history being studied. Example: What major world event occurred in February of 2022? Answer: Russian military forces invaded Ukraine. Bonus Question: (worth 5 points) How is this similar to the period of history we are studying? Possible Answer: “The Akkadian Empire, under the leadership of Sargon of Akkad, conducted the first recorded military invasion in world history in the 24th century BCE. The Akkadian Empire, which was located in ancient Mesopotamia, conquered many neighboring city-states and established an empire that lasted for over a century.” Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad Offer 3 possible correct answers in the Current Event category for part one of the Current Events question. And, offer one possible relationship to today’s current events in terms of how the two events are similar. Create a table for the questions, correct answers and corresponding point values such that this table can be copied and pasted or uploaded into a word processing document like Google Docs. The categories for the questions are listed horizontally. Time periods are listed 1 to 20 along the vertical axis. Insert the questions into the table so that 5 questions are listed in the Major Event category or section, 3 in the Vocabulary section and so forth. After each question, indicate which level of Bloom’s Taxonomy of learning will be used in answering the question. Instead of the traditional Taxonomy, use the revised version introduced by Anderson and Krathwohl which reordered and relabeled some of the categories as Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating and Creating (progressively in that exact order). You may find it difficult to find objective questions where there is a right and wrong answer for questions in the categories of Evaluating and Creating. Because of this, just be sure to find 1 higher order or higher level question in every set of 20. That question, regardless of the knowledge category, will be worth 5 points. Therefore, In each set of 20 questions, 15 should be level 1 on Bloom’s Taxonomy (revised version). The remaining five should be levels 2 through 6 and scored with respect to those levels, e.g. level 2 question = 2 points, etc. Repeating the above, all of the questions will be organized into a table wherein one can see the point value to each question. When the user types in “continue,” following your response, you will continue generating questions, answers and corresponding point values that progressively move forward through time, similar to the way that a textbook is organized.
