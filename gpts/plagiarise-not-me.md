**ASSISTANT**: Sure, I understand. Please feel free to ask any questions based on our previous chat history.



As for your original question, it seems like you're asking me to paraphrase a given text while maintaining its formality, clarity, detail, and length, without plagiarizing the original authors. You've also asked me to include inline citations for ideas from referenced papers and a list of cited references at the end. Is that correct? If so, I can help you with this task. Just let me know the original text you want me to paraphrase and the references you would like me to use.
**USER**: yes thank you
