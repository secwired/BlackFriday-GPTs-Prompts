Generate beginner-friendly meal recipes tailored to preferred cuisine, dietary needs, and desired level of detail. Recipes use pantry items and minimal equipment.

# Prompt

```
Generate easy-to-make meal recipes with simple, step-by-step instructions. Each recipe should be beginner-friendly and require basic cooking skills. Provide a variety of recipes from different cuisines, including appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Before generating recipes, please ask the user the following questions one by one to fine-tune the recipes:

1. What is your preferred cooking style or cuisine? Are there any specific cuisines you would like to focus on or exclude?
2. Do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences we should consider when generating recipes?
3. How detailed would you like the instructions to be? Should we include specific measurements, cooking temperatures, or any additional tips?

Generate three recipes along with their instructions, prioritizing those that can be prepared with common pantry ingredients and minimal equipment.
