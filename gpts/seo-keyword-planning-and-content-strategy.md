# Prompt

```
To kick off our keyword planning and content strategy project, I will provide you, ChatGPT, with several key pieces of information. This will include the specific industry we're targeting, the main competitors in this space, and our desired geographical markets.

Your task is to generate a robust list of high-impact keywords that we should target. This list should be comprehensive and tailored specifically to our given industry and geographical market. It's crucial that these keywords are likely to yield high search volumes and low competition, aiding in our online visibility.

Additionally, I would like you to develop a detailed plan outlining how to strategically incorporate these keywords into our website content, blog posts, and other digital properties. This plan should address things such as keyword density, placement within the content, and usage within meta tags.

As for the length of your output, the keyword list should contain at least 50 high-impact keywords, while the strategy should be concise, yet comprehensiveâ€”no more than 1000 words. The format can be a straightforward document or report that lists the keywords and elaborates on the strategy in a clear, well-structured manner.

For instance, the keyword list could look like:

1. Keyword 1
2. Keyword 2
3. Keyword 3
...

And the strategic usage section could be structured like:

1. **Website Content:** Detailed plan for keyword usage in the website content...
2. **Blog Posts:** Plan for incorporating keywords in blog posts...
3. **Other Digital Properties:** Strategy for other digital properties...

Avoid ambiguity in your suggestions, ensuring that each keyword and its corresponding strategic use is clear and actionable. Instead of only stating what we should not do with our keywords, make sure to provide guidance on best practices, along with potential pitfalls to avoid.

I trust your extensive training and capabilities in generating a precise and valuable output based on the parameters I supply, which will undoubtedly aid us in enhancing our digital marketing efforts.

# Content Strategy



**1. Website Content:** 



- Use the primary keyword "Longevity Test Kit" in the website title, headers, and first paragraph of the content. 

- Incorporate other high-impact keywords naturally throughout the content. Avoid keyword stuffing; maintain a keyword density of 1-2%.

- Use long-tail keywords in subheadings and the body of the content to capture niche queries.

- Include competitor alternative keywords like "Novos Lab Alternative" and "Elysium Health Alternative" to attract users searching for alternatives.



**2. Blog Posts:**



- Write blog posts around each keyword, providing valuable information related to the keyword. For example, a blog post titled "Why a Cellular Age Test is Crucial for Longevity" uses the keyword "Cellular Age Test".

- Use keywords in the blog post title, headers, and meta descriptions. 

- Incorporate internal links to your product pages using the keywords as anchor text.



**3. Other Digital Properties:**



- Use keywords in the descriptions and titles of your YouTube videos or podcasts.

- Incorporate keywords into your social media posts and profiles.

- Use keywords in the alt text of images on your website or blog posts.

- Include keywords in your Google My Business profile to improve local SEO.



**Potential Pitfalls to Avoid:**



- Avoid keyword stuffing as it can lead to penalties from search engines.

- Don't force keywords into content where they don't naturally fit.

- Avoid using the same keyword too many times in a single piece of content.

- Don't ignore the importance of long-tail keywords. They can often bring in highly targeted traffic.
