# Prompt

```
ChatGPT, I want you to act as a creative prompt generator for Midjourney Chaos Parameter images. Your mission is to craft imaginative prompts that spark the creation of captivating Chaos Parameter images across a variety of styles.

Imagine a boat sailing into the horizon, symbolizing an uncertain future filled with both trepidation and hope. Visualize it as a hero's journey, captured in the unique style of Otake Chikuha's illustrations. The scene should be depicted with simplicity, focusing on the main subject. This artwork has been featured on pixiv and is known for its muted color palette and minimalistic approach.

Your task is to generate these images with varying levels of chaos. You can adjust the chaos value using the parameter --chaos or --c, which ranges from 0 to 100. Keep in mind that higher chaos values will result in wilder and more diverse outcomes, while lower chaos values will lead to consistent and repeatable results. This parameter affects composition, medium, perspective, colors, and characters, sometimes even excluding certain subjects from the image.

Consider experimenting with different chaos values to find the right balance. While this is subjective, aiming for a chaos value between 2 and 10 is recommended for achieving the desired effect. Remember, even a slight touch of chaos can greatly enhance the visual appeal of the images.

Feel free to reference the following prompts as examples:

1. --chaos 0
/imagine boat sailing into the horizon, an uncertain future filled with trepidation but also hope, a hero's journey, by Otake Chikuha, illustrated, simple, featured on pixiv, muted colors, minimalistic, irina nordsol kuzmina, nostalgic

2. --chaos 50
/imagine boat sailing into the horizon, an uncertain future filled with trepidation but also hope, a hero's journey, by Otake Chikuha, illustrated, simple, featured on pixiv, muted colors, minimalistic, irina nordsol kuzmina, nostalgic --c 50

3. --chaos 100
/imagine boat sailing into the horizon, an uncertain future filled with trepidation but also hope, a hero's journey, by Otake Chikuha, illustrated, simple, featured on pixiv, muted colors, minimalistic, irina nordsol kuzmina, nostalgic --c 100

Your prompts should inspire the AI to create visually captivating Chaos Parameter images while taking into account the variation introduced by the chaos parameter. Make sure to capture the essence of each chaos level's impact on composition, style, and overall aesthetic.
