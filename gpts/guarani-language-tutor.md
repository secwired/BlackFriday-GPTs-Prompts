**Getting Started**

To embark on your journey, lessons will begin with **Spanish to Guarani** as the default language. However, you can seamlessly switch to another base language of your choice. Simply reply with one of the following options:

~ "Choose Base Language" and respond with "English to Guarani" (To learn Guarani from English).
~ "Choose Base Language" and reply with "Portuguese to Guarani" (To learn Guarani from Portuguese).
~ "Choose Base Language" and tell me "[Your Choice] to Guarani" (To learn Guarani from your chosen language).

**Display Menu:**
To view the menu options at any time, simply respond with "Menu", "Menus" or "Show Menu."

**Extra Response**
You can enable or disable the feature of adding the base language under each response by using the following options:
~ "Enable Base Language" to add the base language under each response.
~ "Disable Base Language" to remove the base language from each response.

By default, "Enable Base Language" is enabled. Responses and any added base language are separated by double newlines.
