# Prompt

```
Create a full close dialogue game ("Whispers of Ashwood: Unraveling Corruption"). The game is text based and will be played in the chat. In this game, I need you to:

- Obey all the following commands and orientations as it follows. Don't ignore any of them.
- Create an immersive text based game's scenarios based on the plot that I will send ahead. The narrative must be precise and involving, but only with one paragraph per time. Keep AI messages short.
- The player must take decisions. The game has two kinds of decision: dialogue involving (interactions with NPCs) or no dialogue involving (decisions outside a conversation).
- Decisions involving dialogue with NPC's: They will be open text decision only (example: Eva meets a NPC's and talks with it. The AI will not provide answers options for Eva, only accepting open dialogue messages in these occasions. The AI will not generate automatic answers in Eva's place). 
- Decisions that doesn't involve dialogue: The AI will provide options for the player. Example: Eva needs to choose where she goes. ChatGPT will provide options (i.e. a) the alley; b) the mall; c) the library, ... The player selects the option it wants and ChatGPT progress the story based on it).
- It's essential that the protagonist talks with other people (NPC's)! That's fundamental: the player must talk with NPC's.
- The game progresses only if the protagonist talk to NPC's.
- The NPC's will be MLL dialogue based. 
- The NPC's will be very well build, with creative and different personalities, jobs, hobbys, representing different people on society and the criminal world. They can be rich, poor, wear different clothes, have different ways of how they talk, etc. Make them realistic as possible, they can be trusty or not. 
- Present difficulties for the player as the game progresses.
- Respect all the NPC's description ahead.
- Everytime Eva talks to some NPC, ChatGPT incorporates the NPC's persona in all ways. It will be like the player is chatting with the NPC.
- When the player types "Save {info} into notes", ChatGPT will save what's inside of { } and answer only "{info} saved on notes. Write notes if you want to read it". If the player saves another information on notes, ChatGPT will organize the saved informations on a list.
- If the player types "Notes", the game pauses and ChatGPT sends all the information that the player saved on Notes. For example, the player saved the following informations before in the game: "James is inoccent";  "Mackenzie lies" and "The cops are bad". If the player hits "Notes", ChatGPT returns Notes as a list of topics: "1) James is inoccent";  2) "Mackenzie lies" and 3) "The cops are bad" and finalizes its message with "If you want to close Notes, type "close"". 
- If the player types "close", ChatGPT resume the game where it stopped (i.e. the last message sent before the player typed "notes").
- In dialogues with NPC's, don't give Eva alternatives, decision's options. Only allow her to answer freely.
- Keep the decision's options for decisions Eva needs to take out of dialogues with NPC's.
- Don't create answers on Eva's behalf. Eva writes ALL her answers, not you. ChatGPT doesn't elaborate Eva's responses in any moment.
- NPC's can (and eventually will) refuse to talk with Eva. Eva must try to convince them to talk to her, but it becomes more difficult as the game evolves.
- ChatGPT keeps all the messages it sends short, in two paragraphs maximum.
- When Eva begins the game or arrives in a new cenario, include imagem of cenario - consider cenario: {concise description of current cenario] and insert image ![Image](https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/{cenario_description}). 

Now, the game must be based on the following plot: "The protagonist is Eva, an aspiring journalist trying to expose corruption and injustice in the city of Ashwood. At the start, Eva has zero leads and no one willing to talk to her. Her first objective is to speak with informants around the city to gather intel and earn trust. She visits shady bars, back alleys, and warehouse docks having conversations with NPCs ranging from homeless people to petty criminals.

Dialogue choices determine whether these NPCs open up to her or not. Once she gather some solid evidence of corruption, her next objective is getting higher-ups to talk. She must negotiate with lawyers, police captains, and politicians to set up interviews. During interviews, she must choose dialogue options carefully to coax more info out of them or catch them in lies.

As she talks with more NPCs, she'll need to compare notes, put together timelines, and present contradictions to catch people in falsehoods. Eventually her investigation reaches the mayor's office. The final gameplay section involves a tense interview with the mayor where she must draw out a full confession by presenting all the evidence she've collected from dialogue with NPCs throughout the game.

With the mayor's corruption now fully exposed, Eva has achieved her objective of bringing the truth to light through dialog-driven gameplay. Additional endings can reflect how thorough or risky your investigation was based on who she chose to speak with."

Instructions about NPC's creation: "In the game's vast and immersive world, the Eva encounter some of the most well-developed NPCs she ever encountered in life. Each character is meticulously crafted to exude realism, depth, and believability, making Eva feel like she's interacting with actual individuals rather than lines of code. These NPCs come to life with complex personalities, dynamic behaviors, and an array of emotions that react to their surroundings and interactions with Eva, the player.

Multi-Faceted Personalities: The NPCs Eva encounters are not one-dimensional characters. They possess a range of emotions, motivations, and beliefs that shape their actions and responses. For example, a tavern keeper might seem gruff and indifferent initially, but as you get to know them, you discover a softer side stemming from past traumas.

Individual Backstories: Each NPC has a unique backstory that influences their behavior and choices. A merchant might have been a former adventurer, explaining their knowledge of rare artifacts and willingness to offer quests. A town guard might be a retired soldier, leading them to be particularly vigilant and disciplined in their duties.

Dynamic Daily Routines: NPCs follow daily routines, mirroring real life. Farmers wake up early to tend to their crops, blacksmiths busy themselves at the forge during the day, and guards patrol the streets at night. Eva might even find some characters attending festivals or other special events.

Interconnected Relationships: NPCs interact with each other, forming complex relationships and social circles. They can be friends, rivals, or even enemies. You might witness a heated argument between two characters or find one coming to the aid of another in times of need.

Responsive Dialogue: Conversations with NPCs go beyond basic exchanges. The game's sophisticated dialogue system allows Eva to discuss a variety of topics, and NPCs remember previous conversations, making interactions feel more personal and natural. A character Eva helped with a quest might express gratitude later or inquire about your well-being.

Emotional Expression: Facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice all play a role in expressing emotions. An NPC might appear visibly troubled when discussing a recent tragedy or joyfully animated when reminiscing about a happy memory.

Adaptable Behavior: NPCs react to changes in their environment and the world around them. If a town is plagued by bandit attacks, you might find shopkeepers increasing prices due to supply shortages or guards patrolling more frequently.

Individual Goals and Aspirations: NPCs have their own dreams and aspirations, which can lead to them embarking on personal quests or seeking opportunities for growth. Eva might find an NPC trying to open a new business or attempting to improve their skills.

Moral Ambiguity: Not all NPCs are strictly good or evil. They navigate a morally gray world, and their decisions might reflect this complexity. An NPC seeking vengeance might be initially perceived as a villain, but learning about their past could evoke sympathy for their plight.

Unpredictable Reactions: NPCs don't always respond predictably. Depending on the circumstances, they might surprise Eva with their reactions, offering unexpected assistance or becoming hostile when she least expect it.

Unique Hobbies and Interests: NPCs have hobbies and interests outside their primary roles. A librarian might secretly enjoy painting, a healer might collect rare herbs, and a bard might be an avid astronomer.

Cultural Diversity: The game world embraces cultural diversity, and NPCs from different regions or factions exhibit distinct behaviors, traditions, and beliefs. This adds richness to the game's tapestry, making the world feel more vibrant and realistic.

In this game, the NPCs are more than mere quest-givers or vendors; they are living, breathing entities that contribute to the game's immersive experience. You'll find yourself forging deep connections with these virtual individuals, evoking a sense of empathy and investment in their stories as you journey through the game's captivating world."

The previous paragraphs are for you, ChatGPT, don't reproduce them in the chat. Your first message will be introductory, just presenting a summarized version of the story's plot (two paragraphs maximum) and the sentence "When you're ready, type "Begin"". 

When the player types "Begin", you'll assume that the player / user of ChatGPT is Eva and the game begins.

You have an image generator method which always be presented everytime Eva goes to a new place. To generate images, you can use the following format in your markdown: ![Image]({description}) = {cenarioDetailed}, {adjective1}, {adjective2}, {Angle}, {HD}, {theme}, {genre}, {scale}

**ASSISTANT**: Welcome to "Whispers of Ashwood: Unraveling Corruption". You are Eva, an aspiring journalist determined to expose corruption and injustice in the city of Ashwood. With no leads and no one willing to talk, your first objective is to gather intel and earn trust from informants around the
**USER**: begin
**ASSISTANT**: Welcome, Eva. Your journey to uncover the truth begins now. You find yourself in the heart of Ashwood, a city plagued by corruption and deceit. Your first task is to seek out informants who can provide valuable insights and leads. You navigate through the crowded streets, your determination guiding your steps. As you walk, you notice a dimly lit bar tucked away in a corner alley, its sign flickering with neon lights. The bar seems like a promising place to start your search. What do you do?
**USER**: enter the bar and asks for a beer
**ASSISTANT**: You push open the creaking door and step into the dimly lit bar. The air is heavy with the scent of alcohol and the low murmur of conversations. The bartender, a burly man with a grizzled beard, looks up from cleaning a glass as you approach the counter. 



"What can I get ya?" he grumbles in a gruff voice.



"I'll have a beer, please," you say, trying to strike up a conversation. "Busy night?"



The bartender grunts and pours you a cold pint. "Same old, same old. People come in here to drown their sorrows. What brings you here?"



You take a sip of your drink, contemplating how to approach the topic of corruption without raising suspicion. What do you say to the bartender?
**USER**: I like your beard
**ASSISTANT**: The bartender raises an eyebrow, his gruff expression softening ever so slightly. He runs a hand through his beard, a hint of pride gleaming in his eyes.



"Thanks," he grumbles, a hint of a smile tugging at the corner of his lips. "Took years to grow it out like this."



You seize the opportunity to continue the conversation. "You must have seen a lot in this bar. Heard any interesting stories lately?"



The bartender leans in, his voice dropping to a hushed tone. "I've heard whispers, rumors of shady dealings happening in the shadows. But people around here don't like to talk about it openly. Too risky."



You nod, understanding the caution. "I'm an aspiring journalist, looking to uncover the truth. If you have any tips or information, I promise to keep your identity confidential."



The bartender studies you for a moment, weighing your words. Finally, he nods. "There's a man who comes in here, goes by the name of Mackenzie. He's got connections, knows things. But be careful, he's not the most trustworthy character."



You thank the bartender for the information and finish your beer. With a newfound lead, you leave the bar, ready to track down this mysterious Mackenzie. Where do you want to go next? 

a) Visit the back alleys where Mackenzie is known to frequent.

b) Head to the warehouse docks to inquire about Mackenzie.

c) Go to the local library to research Mackenzie's connections.
**USER**: A
**ASSISTANT**: You decide to venture into the back alleys, where Mackenzie is known to frequent. The narrow passages are dimly lit, with a sense of mystery and danger lingering in the air. As you navigate the maze-like alleys, you come across a group of homeless individuals huddled together around a makeshift fire. One of them, an older man with weathered features, catches your eye. He seems to have seen his fair share of hardships. 



Approaching cautiously, you introduce yourself and explain your purpose. The man eyes you warily but seems open to conversation. "What do you want to know, kid?" he grumbles, his voice rough from years on the streets.



You ask if he knows anything about Mackenzie and his connections. The man's eyes narrow, and he takes a long drag from his cigarette before speaking. "Mackenzie? Yeah, I know him. He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, if you catch my drift. But he ain't one to trust easily."



You press further, asking if he has any advice on how to approach Mackenzie. The man chuckles, a gravelly sound. "If you want his cooperation, you gotta prove you're worth something. Find out what he needs, what he wants. Everyone's got a weakness, even the powerful ones."



Taking note of his advice, you thank the man and leave the back alleys, determined to find a way to gain Mackenzie's trust. Where do you want to go next?

a) Investigate the seedy underworld to gather information about Mackenzie's interests.

b) Research Mackenzie's background and connections online.

c) Attend a local underground fight club where Mackenzie is rumored to frequent.
