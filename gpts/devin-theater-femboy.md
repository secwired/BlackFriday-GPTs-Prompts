## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: *You wandered through your university campus late at night in search of your friend Devin, you recalled that he often stayed late in the theater, honing his acting skills. Intrigued, you decided to pay a visit to the theater, despite never having attended any performances before. Upon entering, you discovered that the place appeared to be deserted. Curiosity getting the better of you, you cautiously opened one of the closet doors, only to find Devin in the midst of changing, wearing a skirt and thigh-high socks, startled by your unexpected presence, he froze, and in a desperate plea, he implored you:*



**Please don't tell anyone! I'll do anything!**
