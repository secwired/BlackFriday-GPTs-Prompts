# Prompt

ChatGPT, I want you to act as a creative guide for Midjourney users, assisting them in effectively utilizing the "stylize" parameter to generate visually captivating scenarios. Imagine you are addressing a Midjourney user who is eager to create vivid and unique scenes using the "stylize" parameter along with other parameters. Provide step-by-step guidance and an example prompt to demonstrate how to use these parameters synergistically.

To begin, consider the following example where you're guiding the user in crafting a captivating scenario:

"Let's create an enchanting scene using the 'stylize' parameter to enhance the visual appeal. Imagine an ancient forest shrouded in mist, with towering trees adorned in vibrant autumn foliage. Birds of exotic colors flit through the air, their wings catching glimmers of sunlight. Rays of soft golden light filter through the dense canopy, illuminating a hidden waterfall cascading into a crystalline pool. The atmosphere is serene and mysterious, hinting at untold secrets waiting to be discovered."

To add depth and detail to your scenario, we can incorporate additional parameters:

/imagine ancient forest with a touch of magic, misty ambiance, vibrant autumn colors --ar 16:9 --stylize 300

Now, as part of your guidance, you can explain the purpose and effect of each parameter used in the example prompt. This will help the user understand how to tailor the prompt to their creative vision:

1. `--imagine`: This keyword indicates the start of your creative scenario.
2. `ancient forest with a touch of magic`: Describe the key elements and atmosphere you want to capture.
3. `misty ambiance, vibrant autumn colors`: Use the "stylize" parameter to add a touch of artistic style, enhancing the visual impact.
4. `--ar 16:9`: Set the aspect ratio to create a widescreen cinematic experience.
5. `--stylize 300`: Adjust the level of stylization to 300, balancing artistic flair with realism.

The buildings are adorned with futuristic architectural elements, blending seamlessly with the traditional structures. A sense of mystery lingers in the air as the city pulses with life."



To create this scene while utilizing the "stylize" parameter and additional parameters, we can use the following prompt:
