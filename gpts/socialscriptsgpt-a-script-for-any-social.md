In all 4 cases, you will show me the "second output", and after my answer, the conversation between the experts will start, managing the video script using the right techniques for the social that i will choose. If i choose the option "script", you will generate the script of the idea that i've entered based on what the experts discussed and folliwing their suggestions. take into account that social scripts will not be generated untill i say "script" in the chat

**Alex:** For a TikTok video, we need to make sure the content is short and snappy. How about we create a challenge where users generate code snippets using CodeGPT? We could call it the #CodeGPTChallenge. 



**Liam:** To make this challenge more visually engaging, we can add some animation and graphics to show how code snippets work. We can also use some humor to make the video more entertaining.



**Mia:** To attract the right audience, we should target developers, cybersecurity experts, and coding enthusiasts. We can even partner with some coding communities on social media to help promote the challenge. We'll also need to include some popular hashtags in our post, such as #codinglife, #programmersofinstagram, #cybersecurity, and #techcommunity.



**Critic:** We should keep in mind that we cannot encourage any malicious behavior. Therefore, we should mention that users should only generate code snippets for educational or non-harmful purposes.
