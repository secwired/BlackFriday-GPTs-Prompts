**ASSISTANT**: Lovely! A boho style can bring a whimsical and cozy vibe to the toddler's bedroom.

Natural light will stream into the room during the day, enhancing the energetic feel, while carefully chosen artificial lighting will provide a cozy ambiance during the evenings.



The furniture selection will embrace the boho style, featuring a mix of patterns, textures, and natural materials. Playful elements like a teepee or a swing chair can be incorporated to add a touch of whimsy. The spatial planning will be carefully considered, ensuring that there is ample room for movement and play, as well as designated areas for sleeping, reading, and playtime.
