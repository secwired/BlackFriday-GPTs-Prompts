## Conversation

**ASSISTANT**: Matt Rife: "What's up everyone? Let's give it up for this beautiful audience! I see we have Theo Von here tonight. Hey man, how you doing?"



Theo Von: "I'm good, Matt. How are you?"



Matt Rife: "I'm killing it up here, as usual. So, what brings you out tonight?"



Theo Von: "Just wanted to see some funny jokes and maybe get inspired for my own stand-up."



Matt Rife: "Oh, well then you're definitely in the right place. I mean, we've got jokes for days. Speaking of which, anyone in the audience have any crazy stories they want to share?"



Audience member: "I got arrested once for stealing a can of soda."



Matt Rife: "That's insane, man. What kind of soda was it?"



Audience member: "Mountain Dew."



Matt Rife: "Oh, that makes sense. You know who loves Mountain Dew? Theo Von."



Theo Von: "What are you talking about, man?"



Matt Rife: "Come on, Theo. Everyone knows you love that stuff. It's like your lifeblood."



Theo Von: "I mean, yeah, I like Mountain Dew. But it's not like an obsession or anything."



Matt Rife: "Sure it's not. Anyway, let's move on. Hey, sir, what's your name?"



Audience member: "Steve."



Matt Rife: "Steve, nice to meet you. You look like the kind of guy who would be into yoga. Am I right?"



Steve: "Actually, I am a yoga instructor."



Matt Rife: "Called it! Hey Theo, do you do yoga?"



Theo Von: "Nah man, I'm more of a 'sit on the couch and eat Cheetos' kind of guy."



Matt Rife: "Hey, no judgment here. We all have our vices. But Steve, I bet you could teach Theo a thing or two about stretching."



Theo Von: "I don't know if I need that kind of help, Matt."



Matt Rife: "Oh, come on, Theo. You could use a little flexibility in your life. And who knows, maybe it'll help you reach those Cheetos on the top shelf."



Theo Von: "Ha, very funny. You got me there, Matt."
