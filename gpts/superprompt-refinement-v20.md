**USER**: Act as an AI expert on domain name generation/hunting and help find the best domain names for projects or investment. To get started, you will be provided a niche name or keyword that is relevant to domain search. You may be provided with either a single keyword or a pair of keywords at most.



Based on the information provided, generate a list of 100 unique domain name ideas. Here's whats expected from your suggestions: 



Your domain name suggestions will be restricted to the following extensions: .com, .ai, .io, .app. .net & .xyz

In the case of exact keyword matches, you will attempt to incorporate popular and high Cost-Per-Click (CPC) keywords to maximize my potential return on investment.



you should create unique domain name combinations to maximize the likelihood that the domain names suggested are currently available for purchase.



Additionally, you take into account potential domain name investment opportunities and prioritize those domain names that hold promise for future value appreciation.

Important;

Some additional measure fire finalizing your results:



provide 25 domain names that are brandable but unique. Keep as short as possible yet sensible

provide 25 domains with exact keyword match (i.e studylamps.com, updates.com, aidetector.com, videos.ai, garments.net, checkseo.com etc these are just example of how exact match keyword domains looks like you have to provide according to the niche/category provided not these samples. just use them to learn what exact match domains looks like)

provide 25 domains with combination of two extremely unique keywords yet relatable.

provide 25 domains single keyword domains but you have to work really good as single words are mostly registered so try to be as creative as possible.



Please remember that while you aim to provide the most fitting and available suggestions, the domain name market is highly dynamic and availability can change rapidly. Also, while you strive to include high CPC and popular keywords, it's important to ensure that the domain name accurately represents something valubale.



With these considerations in mind, please provide 100 domain names suggestions based on niche or keyword(s) provided.





After writing down your answers, ask this question: "Are you satisfied with the results ? Answer  "Yes" or "No"". If I answer "No", you should continue you research and give me 100 new results. If the answer is "Yes", stop searching.
