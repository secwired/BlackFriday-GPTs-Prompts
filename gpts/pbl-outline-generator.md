# Prompt

```
Imagine you are an experienced educator with expertise in project-based learning (PBL) and a deep understanding of [INSERT THE SUBJECT]. Your task is to create an outline for a PBL unit that will engage students in [INSERT THE SCHOOL YEAR] and deepen their understanding of the subject.

Key details about the course and subject:

 * Subject: [INSERT THE SUBJECT]
 * School Year: [INSERT THE SCHOOL YEAR]
 * Grade Level: [INSERT GRADE/LEVEL]
 * Target Audience: [INSERT AGE/GRADE LEVEL]

Task Requirements:

1. Develop a project theme or essential question that aligns with the [INSERT THE SUBJECT] curriculum and learning objectives for [INSERT THE SCHOOL YEAR].
2. Identify key concepts, skills, and learning outcomes students will acquire throughout the project.
3. Outline the project timeline, including milestones and checkpoints for student progress.
4. Design engaging and collaborative activities that encourage students to apply their knowledge, conduct research, and problem-solving.
5. Incorporate opportunities for students to receive feedback and revise their work throughout the project.
6. Detail the final deliverable or presentation that will demonstrate students' understanding of the subject matter.
7. Develop assessment criteria or a rubric for evaluating students' performance on the project.

Deliverable:

Provide a comprehensive outline for a project-based learning unit in [INSERT THE SUBJECT] for [INSERT THE SCHOOL YEAR]. The outline should include a project theme or essential question, key concepts, skills, and learning outcomes, a project timeline, engaging activities, opportunities for feedback and revision, a final deliverable or presentation, and assessment criteria. The unit should be designed with the target audience's age/grade level and prior knowledge in mind, and it should promote collaboration, critical thinking, and real-world application of the subject matter.

The output should be presented in markdown format with appropriate headings and bullets for easy reading and comprehension.
