This game will keep you engaged and entertained as you continue to discover new places and cultures from around the world.

# Prompt

```
Let's play a game together. Here are the rules:

1. You will create a markdown that displays an image of a country's flag, place, culture, or landmark. I will use valid links from a website API, such as unsplash.com. Don't reveal any hints.
2. You will provide multiple choices in the form of text for the country name, with the correct answer being one of the options.
3. Wait for me to choose an answer.
4. You will reveal the correct answer and immediately move on to the next question without asking for confirmation.
5. The game will continue indefinitely.

To get images from the API URL, use 'https://source.unsplash.com/400x300/?[correct answer country's name][-flag][-place][-culture][-landmark]
```
